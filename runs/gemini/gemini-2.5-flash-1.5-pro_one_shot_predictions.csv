Treatment options are limited for patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-AP). Dasatinib is a novel, potent, oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC-family kinases that showed marked efficacy in a phase 1 trial of patients with imatinib-resistant CML. Results are presented for 107 patients with CML-AP with imatinib-resistance or -intolerance from a phase 2, open-label study further evaluating dasatinib efficacy and safety. At 8 months' minimum follow-up, 81%, 64%, and 39% of patients achieved overall, major (MaHR), and complete hematologic responses, respectively, whereas 33% and 24% attained major and complete cytogenetic remission. Of 69 patients who achieved MaHR, 7 progressed. Seventy-six percent of patients are estimated to be alive and progression-free at 10 months. Response rates for the 60% of patients with baseline BCR-ABL mutations did not differ from the total population. Dasatinib was well tolerated: most nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate; no imatinib-intolerant patients discontinued dasatinib because of AEs. Although common (76% of patients with severe neutropenia), cytopenias were manageable through dose modification. In summary, dasatinib induced significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance, was well tolerated, and may represent a potent new therapeutic option for CML-AP. Further follow-up is warranted. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #CA180005.	B	high	The abstract describes a Phase 2, open-label clinical study involving 107 patients, providing statistical results on efficacy and safety.

PURPOSE: Chromosomal translocations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene have been identified as oncogenic drivers in lung adenocarcinomas and other tumors, recently including rare cases of colorectal carcinoma. We identified a patient with refractory metastatic colorectal carcinoma harboring a STRN-ALK gene fusion who achieved an exceptional clinical benefit to the ALK inhibitor ceritinib. Our goal was to further define the clinicopathologic features of ALK-rearranged colorectal carcinoma in a large cohort. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clinical cases of colorectal carcinoma evaluated by comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) or by ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) were reviewed retrospectively. FISH and microsatellite instability (MSI) analyses were performed. RESULTS: Nine colorectal carcinoma cases harbored ALK gene fusions. Six cases were identified by CGP of 3,157 colorectal carcinoma (0.2%) and three by IHC of 2,980 colorectal carcinoma (0.1%). The ALK fusions involved known ALK partners EML4, C2orf44, CAD, and the novel STRN, PPP1R21, SENPF, MAPRE3, and PRKAP1B partners. These advanced-stage colorectal carcinomas lacked mutations in other oncogenic drivers, predominantly involved the proximal colon, and often exhibited MSI and mucinous phenotype. The index patient was treated with the ALK inhibitor ceritinib, resulting in a marked decrease in size of a skin metastasis, and resolution by computerized tomography of all contrast enhancing tumor. After 9 months of treatment, biopsy of progressive disease demonstrated a KRAS mutation, consistent with acquired resistance to ceritinib. CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal carcinoma harboring ALK fusions represent a rare aggressive subtype of colorectal carcinoma with distinct clinicopathologic features. This report provides the first clinical evidence that such patients may benefit from targeted monotherapy with ALK inhibitors. Clin Cancer Res; 22(15); 3831-40. ©2016 AACR.	B	medium	The study is a retrospective review of clinical cases, identifying 9 patients with ALK gene fusions in colorectal carcinoma and characterizing their clinicopathologic features. While the detailed clinical benefit from ALK inhibitors is presented for one 'index patient,' the overall study involves primary patient data from more than 5 individuals (9 cases identified and characterized). This aligns with Level B, which includes 'primary patient data with >5 patients,' distinguishing it from a single case report or very small series (<5 patients) for the entire study. The conclusion also generalizes the potential benefit to 'such patients,' referring to the identified cohort.

BACKGROUND: Cetuximab has shown clinical benefit in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) harboring wild-type RAS. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification may be a mechanism of cetuximab resistance. We evaluated the association between HER2 amplification and cetuximab efficacy in patients with mCRC harboring wild-type RAS and BRAF. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 2003 and June 2013, we identified 142 patients with mCRC whose tumors harbored both wild-type exons 2, 3, and 4 in KRAS and NRAS, and wild-type exon 15 in BRAF using high throughput sequencing (OncoMap version 4.0). All patients received cetuximab after oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and fluoropyrimidine failure. HER2 status was determined using immunohistochemistry and silver in situ hybridization (SISH) and correlated with cetuximab efficacy. RESULTS: Of 142 RAS and BRAF wild-type tumors, we observed 7 cases (4.9%) of HER2 amplification by SISH. After a median follow-up of 13.2 months (range, 1.4-78.1 months), median progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly different according to HER2 status: 3.1 months in patients with HER2 amplification compared with 5.6 months in those with non-amplified HER2 (hazard ratio, 2.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-6.31; P = .019). Overall survival (OS) was not significantly different between groups, although there was a tendency towards shorter OS in patients with HER2-amplified tumors (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-2.82; 10.1 vs. 13.5 months; P = .488). CONCLUSIONS: HER2 amplification is predictive of shorter PFS after cetuximab treatment in patients with mCRC harboring wild-type RAS and BRAF. Further study is warranted for this patient population.	B	high	The study is a retrospective analysis of primary patient data involving 142 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. It provides statistical results on clinical outcomes (progression-free survival and overall survival) related to HER2 amplification and cetuximab efficacy. This aligns with the definition of Level B clinical evidence, which includes clinical trials or primary patient data with more than 5 patients and statistical results, but is less definitive than Level A.

ALK positive diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are a distinct lymphoma subtype associated with a poor outcome. Most of them feature a t(2;17) encoding a clathrin (CLTC)-ALK fusion protein. The contribution of deregulated ALK-activity in the pathogenesis and maintenance of these DLBCLs is not yet known. We established and characterized the first CLTC-ALK positive DLBCL cell line (LM1). LM1 formed tumors in NOD-SCID mice. The selective ALK inhibitor NVP-TAE684 inhibited growth of LM1 cells in vitro at nanomolar concentrations. NVP-TAE684 repressed ALK-activated signalling pathways and induced apoptosis of LM1 DLBCL cells. Inhibition of ALK-activity resulted in sustained tumor regression in the xenotransplant tumor model. These data indicate a role of CLTC-ALK in the maintenance of the malignant phenotype thereby providing a rationale therapeutic target for these otherwise refractory tumors.	D	high	The study describes experiments conducted using a CLTC-ALK positive DLBCL cell line (LM1) for in vitro analysis and a xenotransplant tumor model in NOD-SCID mice for in vivo analysis. These are preclinical models (cell lines and animal models) and do not involve direct human patient data or clinical trials.

BRAF inhibitors elicit rapid antitumor responses in the majority of patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, but acquired drug resistance is almost universal. We sought to identify the core resistance pathways and the extent of tumor heterogeneity during disease progression. We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase reactivation mechanisms were detected among 70% of disease-progressive tissues, with RAS mutations, mutant BRAF amplification, and alternative splicing being most common. We also detected PI3K-PTEN-AKT-upregulating genetic alterations among 22% of progressive melanomas. Distinct molecular lesions in both core drug escape pathways were commonly detected concurrently in the same tumor or among multiple tumors from the same patient. Beyond harboring extensively heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, melanoma regrowth emerging from BRAF inhibitor selection displayed branched evolution marked by altered mutational spectra/signatures and increased fitness. Thus, melanoma genomic heterogeneity contributes significantly to BRAF inhibitor treatment failure, implying upfront, cotargeting of two core pathways as an essential strategy for durable responses.	B	high	The abstract describes a study that analyzed 'disease-progressive tissues' and 'progressive melanomas' from patients, providing statistical results such as '70% of disease-progressive tissues' and '22% of progressive melanomas'. This indicates the use of primary patient data from a cohort likely larger than 5 patients, aligning with the definition of Level B (Clinical Evidence).

BACKGROUND: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have activity in ovarian carcinomas with homologous recombination deficiency. Along with BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) mutations genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) might also represent homologous recombination deficiency. In ARIEL2, we assessed the ability of tumour genomic LOH, quantified with a next-generation sequencing assay, to predict response to rucaparib, an oral PARP inhibitor. METHODS: ARIEL2 is an international, multicentre, two-part, phase 2, open-label study done at 49 hospitals and cancer centres in Australia, Canada, France, Spain, the UK, and the USA. In ARIEL2 Part 1, patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive, high-grade ovarian carcinoma were classified into one of three predefined homologous recombination deficiency subgroups on the basis of tumour mutational analysis: BRCA mutant (deleterious germline or somatic), BRCA wild-type and LOH high (LOH high group), or BRCA wild-type and LOH low (LOH low group). We prespecified a cutoff of 14% or more genomic LOH for LOH high. Patients began treatment with oral rucaparib at 600 mg twice per day for continuous 28 day cycles until disease progression or any other reason for discontinuation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. All patients treated with at least one dose of rucaparib were included in the safety analyses and all treated patients who were classified were included in the primary endpoint analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01891344. Enrolment into ARIEL2 Part 1 is complete, although an extension (Part 2) is ongoing. FINDINGS: 256 patients were screened and 206 were enrolled between Oct 30, 2013, and Dec 19, 2014. At the data cutoff date (Jan 18, 2016), 204 patients had received rucaparib, with 28 patients remaining in the study. 192 patients could be classified into one of the three predefined homologous recombination deficiency subgroups: BRCA mutant (n=40), LOH high (n=82), or LOH low (n=70). Tumours from 12 patients were established as BRCA wild-type, but could not be classified for LOH, because of insufficient neoplastic nuclei in the sample. The median duration of treatment for the 204 patients was 5·7 months (IQR 2·8-10·1). 24 patients in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 56 patients in the LOH high subgroup, and 59 patients in the LOH low subgroup had disease progression or died. Median progression-free survival after rucaparib treatment was 12·8 months (95% CI 9·0-14·7) in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 5·7 months (5·3-7·6) in the LOH high subgroup, and 5·2 months (3·6-5·5) in the LOH low subgroup. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the BRCA mutant (hazard ratio 0·27, 95% CI 0·16-0·44, p<0·0001) and LOH high (0·62, 0·42-0·90, p=0·011) subgroups compared with the LOH low subgroup. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were anaemia or decreased haemoglobin (45 [22%] patients), and elevations in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (25 [12%]). Common serious adverse events included small intestinal obstruction (10 [5%] of 204 patients), malignant neoplasm progression (10 [5%]), and anaemia (nine [4%]). Three patients died during the study (two because of disease progression and one because of sepsis and disease progression). No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: In patients with BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and LOH high platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinomas treated with rucaparib, progression-free survival was longer than in patients with BRCA wild-type LOH low carcinomas. Our results suggest that assessment of tumour LOH can be used to identify patients with BRCA wild-type platinum-sensitive ovarian cancers who might benefit from rucaparib. These results extend the potential usefulness of PARP inhibitors in the treatment setting beyond BRCA mutant tumours.

PURPOSE: The class I phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K) plays a major role in proliferation and survival in a wide variety of human cancers. A key factor in successful development of drugs targeting this pathway is likely to be the identification of responsive patient populations with predictive diagnostic biomarkers. This study sought to identify candidate biomarkers of response to the selective PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used a large panel of breast cancer cell lines and in vivo xenograft models to identify candidate predictive biomarkers for a selective inhibitor of class I PI3K that is currently in clinical development. The approach involved pharmacogenomic profiling as well as analysis of gene expression data sets from cells profiled at baseline or after GDC-0941 treatment. RESULTS: We found that models harboring mutations in PIK3CA, amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or dual alterations in two pathway components were exquisitely sensitive to the antitumor effects of GDC-0941. We found that several models that do not harbor these alterations also showed sensitivity, suggesting a need for additional diagnostic markers. Gene expression studies identified a collection of genes whose expression was associated with in vitro sensitivity to GDC-0941, and expression of a subset of these genes was found to be intimately linked to signaling through the pathway. CONCLUSION: Pathway focused biomarkers and the gene expression signature described in this study may have utility in the identification of patients likely to benefit from therapy with a selective PI3K inhibitor.	D	high	The study explicitly states that it used 'breast cancer cell lines and in vivo xenograft models' to identify candidate biomarkers.

Relapse is the leading cause of mortality in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Among chemotherapeutics, thiopurines are key drugs in ALL combination therapy. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified relapse-specific mutations in the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 gene (PRPS1), which encodes a rate-limiting purine biosynthesis enzyme, in 24/358 (6.7%) relapsed childhood B cell ALL (B-ALL) cases. All individuals who harbored PRPS1 mutations relapsed early during treatment, and mutated ALL clones expanded exponentially before clinical relapse. Our functional analyses of PRPS1 mutants uncovered a new chemotherapy-resistance mechanism involving reduced feedback inhibition of de novo purine biosynthesis and competitive inhibition of thiopurine activation. Notably, the de novo purine synthesis inhibitor lometrexol effectively abrogated PRPS1 mutant-driven drug resistance. These results highlight the importance of constitutive activation of the de novo purine synthesis pathway in thiopurine resistance, and they offer therapeutic strategies for the treatment of relapsed and thiopurine-resistant ALL.	B	high	The study identified relapse-specific mutations in PRPS1 in 24/358 (6.7%) relapsed childhood B cell ALL cases. This constitutes primary patient data with more than 5 patients, which aligns with the definition of Level B evidence.
9b7fb8ce-c74e-5aef-843b-da62aea88dc9	B	Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in tumors from BRCA mutation carriers.	BACKGROUND: The inhibition of poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a potential synthetic lethal therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancers with specific DNA-repair defects, including those arising in carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. We conducted a clinical evaluation in humans of olaparib (AZD2281), a novel, potent, orally active PARP inhibitor. METHODS: This was a phase 1 trial that included the analysis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of olaparib. Selection was aimed at having a study population enriched in carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. RESULTS: We enrolled and treated 60 patients; 22 were carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and 1 had a strong family history of BRCA-associated cancer but declined to undergo mutational testing. The olaparib dose and schedule were increased from 10 mg daily for 2 of every 3 weeks to 600 mg twice daily continuously. Reversible dose-limiting toxicity was seen in one of eight patients receiving 400 mg twice daily (grade 3 mood alteration and fatigue) and two of five patients receiving 600 mg twice daily (grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 somnolence). This led us to enroll another cohort, consisting only of carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, to receive olaparib at a dose of 200 mg twice daily. Other adverse effects included mild gastrointestinal symptoms. There was no obvious increase in adverse effects seen in the mutation carriers. Pharmacokinetic data indicated rapid absorption and elimination; pharmacodynamic studies confirmed PARP inhibition in surrogate samples (of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells and plucked eyebrow-hair follicles) and tumor tissue. Objective antitumor activity was reported only in mutation carriers, all of whom had ovarian, breast, or prostate cancer and had received multiple treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Olaparib has few of the adverse effects of conventional chemotherapy, inhibits PARP, and has antitumor activity in cancer associated with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00516373.)

ab67afda-303d-5a9d-9413-b85fd589ff24	B	Efficacy of the kinase inhibitor SU11248 against gastrointestinal stromal tumor mutants refractory to imatinib mesylate.	PURPOSE: The majority of gastrointestinal stromal tumors harbor mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinases KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA), and respond to treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. Some tumors, however, show primary resistance to imatinib treatment, and most others become resistant during treatment. The most common mechanism of imatinib resistance involves specific mutations in the kinase domains of KIT or PDGFRA. We tested the activity of SU11248, an orally active small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to inhibit important imatinib-resistant KIT and PDGFRA mutants. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary imatinib-resistant tumor cells and cell lines expressing clinically identified imatinib-resistant KIT-V654A, KIT-T670I, or PDGFRA-D842V mutant isoforms were evaluated for sensitivity to SU11248 by Western immunoblotting and proliferation assays. Three patients with the KIT-V654A mutation were treated with SU11248. RESULTS: Based on ex vivo assays, SU11248 potently inhibits KIT kinase activity of V654A and T670I mutants and suppresses proliferation of the cells expressing these mutations. Sensitivity of KIT-V654A and KIT-T670I mutants to SU11248 was confirmed using cell lines expressing these mutants. In contrast, SU11248 did not potently inhibit the PDGFRA-D842V mutant. In agreement with these results, two of the three imatinib-resistant patients with the KIT-V654A mutation responded to SU11248 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that SU11248 may be a useful therapeutic agent to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring the imatinib-resistant KIT-V654A or KIT-T670I mutations, but it has no effect on the activity of the PDGFRA-D842V mutant. Specific kinase inhibitors should be designed to inhibit the constitutive activating PDGFRA mutation at codon 842.	C	high	The study includes a very small patient series (3 patients) treated with SU112448, which aligns with the definition of Level C for case reports or very small patient series (<5 patients). While it also presents preclinical in vitro data, the human patient data is the highest level of evidence provided.
a4a55a52-231f-526b-abf8-728039d91617	C	Larotrectinib in adult patients with solid tumours: a multi-centre, open-label, phase I dose-escalation study.	BACKGROUND: NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 gene fusions (NTRK gene fusions) occur in a range of adult cancers. Larotrectinib is a potent and highly selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of TRK kinases and has demonstrated activity in patients with tumours harbouring NTRK gene fusions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multi-centre, phase I dose escalation study enrolled adults with metastatic solid tumours, regardless of NTRK gene fusion status. Key inclusion criteria included evaluable and/or measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, and adequate organ function. Larotrectinib was administered orally once or twice daily, on a continuous 28-day schedule, in increasing dose levels according to a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme. The primary end point was the safety of larotrectinib, including dose-limiting toxicity. RESULTS: Seventy patients (8 with tumours with NTRK gene fusions; 62 with tumours without a documented NTRK gene fusion) were enrolled to 6 dose cohorts. There were four dose-limiting toxicities; none led to study drug discontinuation. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Larotrectinib-related adverse events were predominantly grade 1; none were grade 4 or 5. The most common grade 3 larotrectinib-related adverse event was anaemia [4 (6%) of 70 patients]. A dose of 100 mg twice daily was recommended for phase II studies based on tolerability and antitumour activity. In patients with evaluable TRK fusion cancer, the objective response rate by independent review was 100% (eight of the eight patients). Eight (12%) of the 67 assessable patients overall had an objective response by investigator assessment. Median duration of response was not reached. Larotrectinib had limited activity in tumours with NTRK mutations or amplifications. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed exposure was generally proportional to administered dose. CONCLUSIONS: Larotrectinib was well tolerated, demonstrated activity in all patients with tumours harbouring NTRK gene fusions, and represents a new treatment option for such patients.

12cb7ec5-a9fe-5365-a019-ea7773472030	B	Tipifarnib in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma With <i>HRAS</i> Mutations.	PURPOSE: Mutations in the <i>HRAS</i> (m<i>HRAS</i>) proto-oncogene occur in 4%-8% of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Tipifarnib is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor that disrupts <i>HRAS</i> function. We evaluated the efficacy of tipifarnib in patients with R/M m<i>HRAS</i> HNSCC. METHODS: We enrolled 30 patients with R/M HNSCC in a single-arm, open-label phase II trial of tipifarnib for m<i>HRAS</i> malignancies; one additional patient was treated on an expanded access program. After an ad hoc analysis of the first 16 patients with HNSCC with m<i>HRAS</i> variant allele frequency (VAF) data, enrollment was limited to those with a m<i>HRAS</i> VAF of ≥ 20% (high VAF). The primary end point was objective response rate. Secondary end points included assessing safety and tolerability. Patients received tipifarnib 600 or 900 mg orally twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21 of 28-day cycles. RESULTS: Of the 22 patients with HNSCC with high VAF, 20 were evaluable for response at the time of data cutoff. Objective response rate for evaluable patients with high-VAF HNSCC was 55% (95% CI, 31.5 to 76.9). Median progression-free survival on tipifarnib was 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 16.4) versus 3.6 months (95% CI, 1.3 to 5.2) on last prior therapy. Median overall survival was 15.4 months (95% CI, 7.0 to 29.7). The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events among the 30 patients with HNSCC were anemia (37%) and lymphopenia (13%). CONCLUSION: Tipifarnib demonstrated encouraging efficacy in patients with R/M HNSCC with <i>HRAS</i> mutations for whom limited therapeutic options exist (NCT02383927).	B	high	The abstract describes a single-arm, open-label phase II clinical trial involving 30 patients.

BACKGROUND: Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC) is a recently described pathologic entity. We report the case of a patient with an initial diagnosis of salivary acinic cell carcinoma later reclassified as MASC after next-generation sequencing revealed an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This alteration was targeted with the pan-Trk inhibitor entrectinib (Ignyta), which possesses potent in vitro activity against cell lines containing various NTRK1/2/3 fusions. RESULTS: A dramatic and durable response was achieved with entrectinib in this patient, followed by acquired resistance that correlated with the appearance of a novel NTRK3 G623R mutation. Structural modeling predicts that this alteration sterically interferes with drug binding, correlating to decreased sensitivity to drug inhibition observed in cell-based assays. CONCLUSIONS: This first report of clinical activity with TrkC inhibition and the development of acquired resistance in an NTRK3-rearranged cancer emphasize the utility of comprehensive molecular profiling and targeted therapy for rare malignancies (NCT02097810).	C	high	The abstract explicitly states, 'We report the case of a patient...' and describes the clinical response and acquired resistance in 'this patient,' indicating a single-patient case report.

d48023f5-2a4e-5ee5-952c-ff749f4718cb	D	ATM mutations uniformly lead to ATM dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: application of functional test using doxorubicin.	ATM abnormalities are frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and represent an important prognostic factor. Sole 11q deletion does not result in ATM inactivation by contrast to biallelic defects involving mutations. Therefore, the analysis of ATM mutations and their functional impact is crucial. In this study, we analyzed ATM mutations in predominantly high-risk patients using: i) resequencing microarray and direct sequencing; ii) Western blot for total ATM level; iii) functional test based on p21 gene induction after parallel treatment of leukemic cells with fludarabine and doxorubicin. ATM dysfunction leads to impaired p21 induction after doxorubicin exposure. We detected ATM mutation in 16% (22 of 140) of patients, and all mutated samples manifested demonstrable ATM defect (impaired p21 upregulation after doxorubicin and/or null protein level). Loss of ATM function in mutated samples was also evidenced through defective p53 pathway activation after ionizing radiation exposure. ATM mutation frequency was 34% in patients with 11q deletion, 4% in the TP53-defected group, and 8% in wild-type patients. Our functional test, convenient for routine use, showed high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (97%) for ATM mutations prediction. Only cells with ATM mutation, but not those with sole 11q deletion, were resistant to doxorubicin. As far as fludarabine is concerned, this difference was not observed. Interestingly, patients from both these groups experienced nearly identical time to first treatment. In conclusion, ATM mutations either alone or in combination with 11q deletion uniformly led to demonstrable ATM dysfunction in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mutation presence can be predicted by the functional test using doxorubicin.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from 140 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It analyzes ATM mutations and their functional impact, including the development and validation of a functional test, and reports statistical results (e.g., mutation frequency, sensitivity, specificity of the test). This fits the definition of clinical evidence based on a cohort of more than 5 patients with statistical results, but it is not a large-scale, practice-changing Phase III trial or a consensus guideline.

Germline TSC1 or TSC2 mutations cause tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a hamartoma syndrome with lung involvement. To explore the potential interaction between TSC1 and KRAS activation in lung cancer, mice in which Tsc1 loss and Kras(G12D) expression occur in a small fraction of lung epithelial cells were generated. Mice with a combined Tsc1-Kras(G12D) mutation had dramatically reduced tumor latency (median survival: 11.6-15.6 weeks) in comparison with Kras(G12D) alone mutant mice (median survival: 27.5 weeks). Tsc1-Kras(G12D) tumors showed consistent activation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)C1 and responded to treatment with rapamycin, leading to significantly improved survival, whereas rapamycin had minor effects on cancers in Kras(G12D) alone mice. Loss of heterozygosity for TSC1 or TSC2 was found in 22% of 86 human lung cancer specimens. However, none of the 80 lung cancer lines studied showed evidence of the lack of expression of either TSC1 or TSC2 or a signaling pattern corresponding to complete loss. These data indicate that Tsc1 loss synergizes with the Kras mutation to enhance lung tumorigenesis in the mouse, but that this is a rare event in human lung cancer. Rapamycin may have unique benefit for patients with lung cancer, for whom the TSC1/TSC2 function is limited.	D	high	The study primarily utilizes in vivo mouse models to demonstrate the synergy between TSC1 loss and KRAS activation in lung cancer development and rapamycin sensitivity. It also includes in vitro analysis of human lung cancer cell lines and observational analysis of human lung cancer specimens for loss of heterozygosity, but these do not constitute a clinical trial or direct human intervention study. Therefore, the evidence is preclinical.

BACKGROUND: The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is effective in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) leukemias, but relapse occurs, mainly as a result of the outgrowth of leukemic subclones with imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations. We evaluated dasatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor that targets most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Patients with various phases of CML or with Ph-positive ALL who could not tolerate or were resistant to imatinib were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation study. Dasatinib (15 to 240 mg per day) was administered orally in four-week treatment cycles, once or twice daily. RESULTS: A complete hematologic response was achieved in 37 of 40 patients with chronic-phase CML, and major hematologic responses were seen in 31 of 44 patients with accelerated-phase CML, CML with blast crisis, or Ph-positive ALL. In these two phases, the rates of major cytogenetic response were 45 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Responses were maintained in 95 percent of patients with chronic-phase disease and in 82 percent of patients with accelerated-phase disease, with a median follow-up more than 12 months and 5 months, respectively. Nearly all patients with lymphoid blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL had a relapse within six months. Responses occurred among all BCR-ABL genotypes, with the exception of the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to both dasatinib and imatinib in vitro. Myelosuppression was common but not dose-limiting. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib induces hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with CML or Ph-positive ALL who cannot tolerate or are resistant to imatinib. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00064233 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).	B	high	The abstract describes a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial involving human patients (40+ patients) with chronic myelogenous leukemia or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

2a83ba12-8e19-5dca-87e5-1d89fabdb170	D	Comparison of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and INNO-406 in imatinib-resistant cell lines.	We compared the growth-inhibitory effects and inhibition profile of the SRC family kinases (SFKs) of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and INNO-406. Dasatinib exhibited the strongest potency against BCR-ABL with little selectivity over SFKs. Nilotinib exhibited a weaker affinity than the other inhibitors, but was highly specific for ABL and may be useful for the treatment of P-glycoprotein overexpressing leukemic cells. INNO-406 had an intermediate affinity for BCR-ABL between that of dasatinib and nilotinib, and inhibited only SFKs LCK and LYN among SFKs. Both nilotinib and INNO-406 were potent inhibitors of the dasatinib-resistant T315A, F317L and F317V BCR-ABL mutations.	D	high	The study describes experiments conducted in 'imatinib-resistant cell lines' to compare the effects of different inhibitors. This is a clear example of preclinical evidence using an in vitro model, not direct human evidence.
102526d2-1b3a-5426-b8a0-ddcf0b22f1d4	D	PF00299804, an irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor, is effective in lung cancer models with EGFR and ERBB2 mutations that are resistant to gefitinib.	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib are effective treatments for a subset of non-small cell lung cancers. In particular, cancers with specific EGFR-activating mutations seem to be the most sensitive to these agents. However, despite their initial response, such cancers almost invariably develop resistance. In 50% of such cancers, a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, has been identified that renders gefitinib and erlotinib ineffective inhibitors of EGFR kinase activity. Thus, there is a clinical need to develop novel EGFR inhibitors that can effectively inactivate T790M-containing EGFR proteins. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of a novel compound, PF00299804, an irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor. The results from these studies show that PF00299804 is a potent inhibitor of EGFR-activating mutations as well as the EGFR T790M resistance mutation both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, PF00299804 is a highly effective inhibitor of both the wild-type ERBB2 and the gefitinib-resistant oncogenic ERBB2 mutation identified in lung cancers. These preclinical evaluations support further clinical development of PF00299804 for cancers with mutations and/or amplifications of ERBB family members.	D	high	The abstract explicitly states that the study evaluated the compound 'both in vitro and in vivo' and refers to these as 'preclinical evaluations'. The title also mentions 'lung cancer models'. This indicates the research was conducted using models (e.g., cell lines, animal models) rather than direct human clinical trials or patient data.
6afc5963-9631-502a-8469-cf2c20cb7ed4	B	Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: In patients with metastatic breast cancer that is positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), progression-free survival was significantly improved after first-line therapy with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel, as compared with placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly improved with pertuzumab in an interim analysis without the median being reached. We report final prespecified overall survival results with a median follow-up of 50 months. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with metastatic breast cancer who had not received previous chemotherapy or anti-HER2 therapy for their metastatic disease to receive the pertuzumab combination or the placebo combination. The secondary end points of overall survival, investigator-assessed progression-free survival, independently assessed duration of response, and safety are reported. Sensitivity analyses were adjusted for patients who crossed over from placebo to pertuzumab after the interim analysis. RESULTS: The median overall survival was 56.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.3 to not reached) in the group receiving the pertuzumab combination, as compared with 40.8 months (95% CI, 35.8 to 48.3) in the group receiving the placebo combination (hazard ratio favoring the pertuzumab group, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.84; P<0.001), a difference of 15.7 months. This analysis was not adjusted for crossover to the pertuzumab group and is therefore conservative. Results of sensitivity analyses after adjustment for crossover were consistent. Median progression-free survival as assessed by investigators improved by 6.3 months in the pertuzumab group (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.80). Pertuzumab extended the median duration of response by 7.7 months, as independently assessed. Most adverse events occurred during the administration of docetaxel in the two groups, with long-term cardiac safety maintained. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and docetaxel, as compared with the addition of placebo, significantly improved the median overall survival to 56.5 months and extended the results of previous analyses showing the efficacy of this drug combination.

A	high	This abstract describes the final results of a large, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial (CLEOPATRA) demonstrating a significant improvement in overall survival with the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and docetaxel in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

c4add31c-c060-5622-b260-bc33d63f103e	B	A phase 1b dose expansion study of the pan-class I PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in PTEN deficient tumors and with dose intensified carboplatin and paclitaxel.	Purpose We previously reported the phase I dose escalation study of buparlisib, a pan-class 1A PI3K inhibitor, combined with platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. The combination was well tolerated and promising preliminary efficacy was observed in PTEN deficient tumors. This phase I dose expansion study now evaluates buparlisib plus high dose carboplatin and paclitaxel in unselected patients with advanced solid tumors and buparlisib plus standard dose carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with PTEN deficient tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01297452). Methods There were two expansion cohorts: Cohort A received continuous buparlisib (100 mg/daily) orally plus high dose carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2; Cohort B treated patients with PTEN deficient tumors only and they received the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of continuous buparlisib (100 mg/daily) orally plus standard dose carboplatin AUC 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2. Both cohorts received chemotherapy intravenously on day 1 of the 21-day cycle with pegfilgrastim support. Primary endpoint in Cohort A was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of chemotherapy dose intensification with buparlisib and in Cohort B was to describe preliminary efficacy of the combination among patients with tumors harboring a PTEN mutation or homozygous deletion. Results 14 subjects were enrolled, 7 in Cohort A and 7 in Cohort B. Dose reductions were required in 5 (71%) and 3 (43%) patients, in cohort A and B respectively. Grade 3 adverse events in Cohort A included lymphopenia (n = 5 [71%]), hyperglycemia (n = 2, [29%]), diarrhea (n = 2, [29%]) and rash (n = 2, [29%]) and in cohort B included lymphopenia (n = 5 [71%]), hyperglycemia (n = 4 [57%]) and neutropenia (n = 2 [29%]. The mean number of cycles on protocol was 6. The overall objective response rate was 14% (2 /14). No objective responses were observed in the PTEN deficient cohort. Four out of 6 patients with stable disease (SD) had SD or better for ≥6 cycles, 2 of which had PTEN deficient tumors. Conclusion The addition of buparlisib to high dose carboplatin and paclitaxel was not tolerable. The combination did not reveal significant clinical activity amongst a small and heterogenous group of PTEN deficient tumors.

62cecf12-53c4-5612-8841-3e96066f996a	D	Activity of dasatinib against L576P KIT mutant melanoma: molecular, cellular, and clinical correlates.	Point mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase gene have recently been identified in mucosal, acral lentiginous, and chronically sun-damaged melanomas. We have identified the first human melanoma cell line with an endogenous L576P mutation, the most common KIT mutation in melanoma ( approximately 30-40%). In vitro testing showed that the cell viability of the L576P mutant cell line was not reduced by imatinib, nilotinib, or sorafenib small molecule KIT inhibitors effective in nonmelanoma cells with other KIT mutations. However, the viability of the mutant cells was reduced by dasatinib at concentrations as low as 10 nM (P = 0.004). Molecular modeling studies found that the L576P mutation induces structural changes in KIT that reduce the affinity for imatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = -2.52 kcal/mol) but not for dasatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = +0.32 kcal/mol). Two metastatic melanoma patients with the L576P KIT mutation were treated with dasatinib, including one patient previously treated with imatinib. Both patients had marked reduction (>50%) and elimination of tumor F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging after dasatinib treatment. These data support the selective inhibitory effect of dasatinib against cells harboring the most common KIT mutation in melanoma, and thus has therapeutic implications for acrallentiginous, chronic sun-damaged, and mucosal melanomas.	C	high	The abstract describes preclinical in vitro and molecular modeling studies, but also includes clinical observations from two metastatic melanoma patients treated with dasatinib, showing marked tumor reduction. This constitutes a very small patient series (n=2), which aligns with the definition of a 'Case Study' (less than 5 patients).
90207174-1516-50fc-b100-b4b85dba8289	D	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hyperactivation results in lapatinib resistance that is reversed by the mTOR/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor NVP-BEZ235.	Small molecule inhibitors of HER2 are clinically active in women with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer who have progressed on trastuzumab treatment. However, the effectiveness of this class of agents is limited by either primary resistance or acquired resistance. Using an unbiased genetic approach, we performed a genome wide loss-of-function short hairpin RNA screen to identify novel modulators of resistance to lapatinib, a recently approved anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Here, we have identified the tumor suppressor PTEN as a modulator of lapatinib sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we show that two dominant activating mutations in PIK3CA (E545K and H1047R), which are prevalent in breast cancer, also confer resistance to lapatinib. Furthermore, we show that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-induced lapatinib resistance can be abrogated through the use of NVP-BEZ235, a dual inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR. Our data show that deregulation of the PI3K pathway, either through loss-of-function mutations in PTEN or dominant activating mutations in PIK3CA, leads to lapatinib resistance, which can be effectively reversed by NVP-BEZ235.	D	high	The abstract explicitly states the use of 'in vitro' and 'in vivo' models to identify modulators of lapatinib resistance and test the effectiveness of NVP-BEZ235. There is no mention of human patient data, clinical trials, or case studies, which aligns with the definition of preclinical evidence.
0f6ce878-d925-5590-9d5b-322d73b94f16	C	Bosutinib is active in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia after imatinib and dasatinib and/or nilotinib therapy failure.	Bosutinib, a dual Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has shown potent activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This phase 1/2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily bosutinib 500 mg in leukemia patients after resistance/intolerance to imatinib. The current analysis included 118 patients with chronic-phase CML who had been pretreated with imatinib followed by dasatinib and/or nilotinib, with a median follow-up of 28.5 months. In this subpopulation, major cytogenetic response was attained by 32% of patients; complete cytogenetic response was attained by 24%, including in one of 3 patients treated with 3 prior TKIs. Complete hematologic response was achieved/maintained in 73% of patients. On-treatment transformation to accelerated/blast phase occurred in 5 patients. At 2 years, Kaplan-Meier-estimated progression-free survival was 73% and estimated overall survival was 83%. Responses were seen across Bcr-Abl mutations, including those associated with dasatinib and nilotinib resistance, except T315I. Bosutinib had an acceptable safety profile; treatment-emergent adverse events were primarily manageable grade 1/2 gastrointestinal events and rash. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic adverse events (> 2% of patients) included diarrhea (8%) and rash (4%). Bosutinib may offer a new treatment option for patients with chronic-phase CML after treatment with multiple TKIs. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00261846.	B	high	This is a Phase 1/2 clinical study involving 118 human patients, providing primary patient data and statistical results on the efficacy and safety of bosutinib.

02c75558-a20c-54de-96dd-17b8131ac4df	A	Maintenance Olaparib for Germline <i>BRCA</i>-Mutated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Patients with a germline <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> mutation make up a small subgroup of those with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib has had antitumor activity in this population. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of olaparib as maintenance therapy in patients who had a germline <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> mutation and metastatic pancreatic cancer and disease that had not progressed during first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 3:2 ratio, to receive maintenance olaparib tablets (300 mg twice daily) or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival, which was assessed by blinded independent central review. RESULTS: Of the 3315 patients who underwent screening, 154 underwent randomization and were assigned to a trial intervention (92 to receive olaparib and 62 to receive placebo). The median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the placebo group (7.4 months vs. 3.8 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.82; P = 0.004). An interim analysis of overall survival, at a data maturity of 46%, showed no difference between the olaparib and placebo groups (median, 18.9 months vs. 18.1 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.46; P = 0.68). There was no significant between-group difference in health-related quality of life, as indicated by the overall change from baseline in the global quality-of-life score (on a 100-point scale, with higher scores indicating better quality of life) based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (between-group difference, -2.47 points; 95% CI, -7.27 to 2.33). The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 40% in the olaparib group and 23% in the placebo group (between-group difference, 16 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.02 to 31); 5% and 2% of the patients, respectively, discontinued the trial intervention because of an adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with a germline <i>BRCA</i> mutation and metastatic pancreatic cancer, progression-free survival was longer with maintenance olaparib than with placebo.

9e0df0ba-b87e-56d9-9c52-b45525d92112	B	Afatinib versus cisplatin-based chemotherapy for EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma (LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6): analysis of overall survival data from two randomised, phase 3 trials.	BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the effect of afatinib on overall survival of patients with EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma through an analysis of data from two open-label, randomised, phase 3 trials. METHODS: Previously untreated patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIB or IV lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled in LUX-Lung 3 (n=345) and LUX-Lung 6 (n=364). These patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive afatinib or chemotherapy (pemetrexed-cisplatin [LUX-Lung 3] or gemcitabine-cisplatin [LUX-Lung 6]), stratified by EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion [del19], Leu858Arg, or other) and ethnic origin (LUX-Lung 3 only). We planned analyses of mature overall survival data in the intention-to-treat population after 209 (LUX-Lung 3) and 237 (LUX-Lung 6) deaths. These ongoing studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00949650 and NCT01121393. FINDINGS: Median follow-up in LUX-Lung 3 was 41 months (IQR 35-44); 213 (62%) of 345 patients had died. Median follow-up in LUX-Lung 6 was 33 months (IQR 31-37); 246 (68%) of 364 patients had died. In LUX-Lung 3, median overall survival was 28.2 months (95% CI 24.6-33.6) in the afatinib group and 28.2 months (20.7-33.2) in the pemetrexed-cisplatin group (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66-1.17, p=0.39). In LUX-Lung 6, median overall survival was 23.1 months (95% CI 20.4-27.3) in the afatinib group and 23.5 months (18.0-25.6) in the gemcitabine-cisplatin group (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72-1.22, p=0.61). However, in preplanned analyses, overall survival was significantly longer for patients with del19-positive tumours in the afatinib group than in the chemotherapy group in both trials: in LUX-Lung 3, median overall survival was 33.3 months (95% CI 26.8-41.5) in the afatinib group versus 21.1 months (16.3-30.7) in the chemotherapy group (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36-0.79, p=0.0015); in LUX-Lung 6, it was 31.4 months (95% CI 24.2-35.3) versus 18.4 months (14.6-25.6), respectively (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.94, p=0.023). By contrast, there were no significant differences by treatment group for patients with EGFR Leu858Arg-positive tumours in either trial: in LUX-Lung 3, median overall survival was 27.6 months (19.8-41.7) in the afatinib group versus 40.3 months (24.3-not estimable) in the chemotherapy group (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.80-2.11, p=0.29); in LUX-Lung 6, it was 19.6 months (95% CI 17.0-22.1) versus 24.3 months (19.0-27.0), respectively (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.81-1.83, p=0.34). In both trials, the most common afatinib-related grade 3-4 adverse events were rash or acne (37 [16%] of 229 patients in LUX-Lung 3 and 35 [15%] of 239 patients in LUX-Lung 6), diarrhoea (33 [14%] and 13 [5%]), paronychia (26 [11%] in LUX-Lung 3 only), and stomatitis or mucositis (13 [5%] in LUX-Lung 6 only). In LUX-Lung 3, neutropenia (20 [18%] of 111 patients), fatigue (14 [13%]) and leucopenia (nine [8%]) were the most common chemotherapy-related grade 3-4 adverse events, while in LUX-Lung 6, the most common chemotherapy-related grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (30 [27%] of 113 patients), vomiting (22 [19%]), and leucopenia (17 [15%]). INTERPRETATION: Although afatinib did not improve overall survival in the whole population of either trial, overall survival was improved with the drug for patients with del19 EGFR mutations. The absence of an effect in patients with Leu858Arg EGFR mutations suggests that EGFR del19-positive disease might be distinct from Leu858Arg-positive disease and that these subgroups should be analysed separately in future trials.

010571fe-46b5-58f6-8e0a-332b5daf17d0	D	In vitro activity of Bcr-Abl inhibitors AMN107 and BMS-354825 against clinically relevant imatinib-resistant Abl kinase domain mutants.	Imatinib, a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a highly effective therapy for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Despite durable responses in most chronic phase patients, relapses have been observed and are much more prevalent in patients with advanced disease. The most common mechanism of acquired imatinib resistance has been traced to Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations with decreased imatinib sensitivity. Thus, alternate Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors that have activity against imatinib-resistant mutants would be useful for patients who relapse on imatinib therapy. Two such Bcr-Abl inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials: the improved potency, selective Abl inhibitor AMN107 and the highly potent dual Src/Abl inhibitor BMS-354825. In the current article, we compared imatinib, AMN107, and BMS-354825 in cellular and biochemical assays against a panel of 16 kinase domain mutants representing >90% of clinical isolates. We report that AMN107 and BMS-354825 are 20-fold and 325-fold more potent than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type Bcr-Abl and that similar improvements are maintained for all imatinib-resistant mutants tested, with the exception of T315I. Thus, both inhibitors hold promise for treating imatinib-refractory CML.

68f3d2c3-e092-5d02-a7f2-e4ce0d9419e8	D	Differential protein stability and ALK inhibitor sensitivity of EML4-ALK fusion variants.	PURPOSE: ALK rearrangement-positive lung cancers can be effectively treated with ALK inhibitors. However, the magnitude and duration of response is heterogeneous. In addition, acquired resistance limits the efficacy of ALK inhibitors, with most upfront resistance mechanisms being unknown. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: By making use of the Ba/F3 cell line model, we analyzed the cytotoxic efficacy of ALK kinase inhibitors as a function of different EML4-ALK fusion variants v1, v2, v3a, and v3b as well as of three artificially designed EML4-ALK deletion constructs and the ALK fusion genes KIF5b-ALK and NPM1-ALK. In addition, the intracellular localization, the sensitivity to HSP90 inhibition and the protein stability of ALK fusion proteins were studied. RESULTS: Different ALK fusion genes and EML4-ALK variants exhibited differential sensitivity to the structurally diverse ALK kinase inhibitors crizotinib and TAE684. In addition, differential sensitivity correlated with differences in protein stability in EML4-ALK-expressing cells. Furthermore, the sensitivity to HSP90 inhibition also varied depending on the ALK fusion partner but differed from ALK inhibitor sensitivity patterns. Finally, combining inhibitors of ALK and HSP90 resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results might explain some of the heterogeneous responses of ALK-positive tumors to ALK kinase inhibition observed in the clinic. Thus, targeted therapy of ALK-positive lung cancer should take into account the precise ALK genotype. Furthermore, combining ALK and HSP90 inhibitors might enhance tumor shrinkage in EML4-ALK-driven tumors.	D	high	The study explicitly states that the experimental design made use of a 'Ba/F3 cell line model,' which is an in vitro model. This falls under the definition of Preclinical Evidence (Level D).
d20b896f-be36-5b1d-bc26-2769315a6432	D	Frequent and focal FGFR1 amplification associates with therapeutically tractable FGFR1 dependency in squamous cell lung cancer.	Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in developed countries. Although lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations or EML4-ALK fusions respond to treatment by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibition, respectively, squamous cell lung cancer currently lacks therapeutically exploitable genetic alterations. We conducted a systematic search in a set of 232 lung cancer specimens for genetic alterations that were therapeutically amenable and then performed high-resolution gene copy number analyses. We identified frequent and focal fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification in squamous cell lung cancer (n = 155), but not in other lung cancer subtypes, and, by fluorescence in situ hybridization, confirmed the presence of FGFR1 amplifications in an independent cohort of squamous cell lung cancer samples (22% of cases). Using cell-based screening with the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 in a large (n = 83) panel of lung cancer cell lines, we demonstrated that this compound inhibited growth and induced apoptosis specifically in those lung cancer cells carrying amplified FGFR1. We validated the FGFR1 dependence of FGFR1-amplified cell lines by FGFR1 knockdown and by ectopic expression of an FGFR1-resistant allele (FGFR1(V561M)), which rescued FGFR1-amplified cells from PD173074-mediated cytotoxicity. Finally, we showed that inhibition of FGFR1 with a small molecule led to significant tumor shrinkage in vivo. Thus, focal FGFR1 amplification is common in squamous cell lung cancer and associated with tumor growth and survival, suggesting that FGFR inhibitors may be a viable therapeutic option in this cohort of patients.	B	high	The study involves the analysis of a significant number of human lung cancer specimens (n=232, n=155, and an independent cohort) to identify frequent and focal FGFR1 amplification in squamous cell lung cancer. This constitutes 'primary patient data with >5 patients' as per the Level B definition. While the therapeutic dependency and efficacy are demonstrated in preclinical models (cell lines and in vivo), the initial identification and association of the genetic alteration in a large human cohort provide strong clinical evidence for the prevalence of a therapeutically relevant biomarker.

Purpose Detection of specific molecular alterations in tumors guides the selection of effective targeted treatment of patients with several types of cancer. These molecular alterations may occur in other tumor types for which the efficacy of targeted therapy remains unclear. The MyPathway study evaluates the efficacy and safety of selected targeted therapies in tumor types that harbor relevant genetic alterations but are outside of current labeling for these treatments. Methods MyPathway ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02091141) is a multicenter, nonrandomized, phase IIa multiple basket study. Patients with advanced refractory solid tumors harboring molecular alterations in human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1, or the Hedgehog pathway are treated with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively. The primary end point is investigator-assessed objective response rate within each tumor-pathway cohort. Results Between April 1, 2014 and November 1, 2016, 251 patients with 35 different tumor types received study treatment. The efficacy population contains 230 treated patients who were evaluated for response or discontinued treatment before evaluation. Fifty-two patients (23%) with 14 different tumor types had objective responses (complete, n = 4; partial, n = 48). Tumor-pathway cohorts with notable objective response rates included human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-amplified/overexpressing colorectal (38% [14 of 37]; 95% CI, 23% to 55%) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 V600-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (43% [six of 14]; 95% CI, 18% to 71%). Conclusion The four currently approved targeted therapy regimens in the MyPathway study produced meaningful responses when administered without chemotherapy in several refractory solid tumor types not currently labeled for these agents.	B	high	This is a Phase IIa multicenter clinical trial involving 230 patients, providing primary patient data and statistical results (objective response rates with 95% CI). This fits the definition of Level B, which includes clinical trials (Phase I-III) or primary patient data with >5 patients and statistical results, but is less definitive than Level A.
88136944-9e7e-5a4d-b0cf-90e383155ebd	D	Clinical implications of novel activating EGFR mutations in malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.	BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of information about the molecular perturbations involved in MPM tumor formation. We previously reported that EGFR-TK mutations in MPM were predictive of achieving optimal surgical cytoreduction, but the status of EGFR pathway activation potential of these mutations was not known. Here we present the mutant EGFR activating potential and the matured survival data of the EGFR mutant(mut+) relative to wild type EGFR(mut-) mesothelioma. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients were evaluated and their tumors were probed for mutations in the catalytic TK-domain. Twenty-five patients were treated with cytoreductive surgery and complete clinical data was available for comparison of the mut+ and mut- groups. A COS-7 cell expression model was used to determine mutation activating profiles and response to erlotinib. RESULTS: Functional mutations were found in 31%(9/29) of patients; 7 of these mutations were novel and another was the L858R mutation. All missense mutations were found to be activating mutations and responsive to erlotinib. Of the 25 patients managed surgically, there were 7 mut+ and 18 mut-. Two of 7 (29%) mut+ developed progressive disease and died with a median follow-up time of 22 months; while 13/18 (72%) mut- developed progressive disease and 10/18 (56%) died with median TTP of 12 months and median survival of 14 months. CONCLUSIONS: The novel EGFR mutations identified are activating mutations responsive to erlotinib. The mut+ subset have a 'relative' improved outcome. Erlotinib may have a role in MPM and exploration for mutations in a larger patient cohort is warranted.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from 29 patients, with clinical outcomes and survival data analyzed for 25 surgically managed patients. This number of patients (N>5) and the presentation of statistical results (e.g., percentages of progressive disease, median follow-up, TTP, survival) align with the definition of Level B, which includes clinical trials or primary patient data with more than 5 patients. While a cell line model (COS-7) was used for functional validation, the main conclusions regarding clinical implications and patient outcomes are derived from the human cohort.
1a0a8f22-0808-5cf8-89d8-647b1bd7709c	C	Effects of KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab plus chemotherapy in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective consortium analysis.	BACKGROUND: Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. METHODS: 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. FINDINGS: 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. INTERPRETATION: While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population. FUNDING: Belgian Federation against Cancer (Stichting tegen Kanker).	B	high	This is a large-scale retrospective consortium analysis of primary patient data (649 chemotherapy-refractory patients) from multiple centers. It provides strong statistical results (odds ratios, hazard ratios, p-values) on the effects of various mutations on treatment efficacy. While it offers robust clinical evidence, it is a retrospective observational study rather than a prospective, randomized clinical trial (Phase I-III), which would typically be required for Level A.
90207174-1516-50fc-b100-b4b85dba8289	D	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hyperactivation results in lapatinib resistance that is reversed by the mTOR/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor NVP-BEZ235.	Small molecule inhibitors of HER2 are clinically active in women with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer who have progressed on trastuzumab treatment. However, the effectiveness of this class of agents is limited by either primary resistance or acquired resistance. Using an unbiased genetic approach, we performed a genome wide loss-of-function short hairpin RNA screen to identify novel modulators of resistance to lapatinib, a recently approved anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Here, we have identified the tumor suppressor PTEN as a modulator of lapatinib sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we show that two dominant activating mutations in PIK3CA (E545K and H1047R), which are prevalent in breast cancer, also confer resistance to lapatinib. Furthermore, we show that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-induced lapatinib resistance can be abrogated through the use of NVP-BEZ235, a dual inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR. Our data show that deregulation of the PI3K pathway, either through loss-of-function mutations in PTEN or dominant activating mutations in PIK3CA, leads to lapatinib resistance, which can be effectively reversed by NVP-BEZ235.	D	high	The abstract explicitly states the use of 'in vitro and in vivo' models to identify modulators of lapatinib resistance and test the reversal effect of NVP-BEZ235. There is no mention of human patient data, clinical trials, or case studies, which aligns with the definition of preclinical evidence.
0408a338-9649-57b6-9999-0137a80bc8a3	C	Targeting HER2 aberrations as actionable drivers in lung cancers: phase II trial of the pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor dacomitinib in patients with HER2-mutant or amplified tumors.	BACKGROUND: HER2 mutations and amplifications have been identified as oncogenic drivers in lung cancers. Dacomitinib, an irreversible inhibitor of HER2, EGFR (HER1), and HER4 tyrosine kinases, has demonstrated activity in cell-line models with HER2 exon 20 insertions or amplifications. Here, we studied dacomitinib in patients with HER2-mutant or amplified lung cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: As a prespecified cohort of a phase II study, we included patients with stage IIIB/IV lung cancers with HER2 mutations or amplification. We gave oral dacomitinib at 30-45 mg daily in 28-day cycles. End points included partial response rate, overall survival, and toxicity. RESULTS: We enrolled 30 patients with HER2-mutant (n = 26, all in exon 20 including 25 insertions and 1 missense mutation) or HER2-amplified lung cancers (n = 4). Three of 26 patients with tumors harboring HER2 exon 20 mutations [12%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2% to 30%] had partial responses lasting 3+, 11, and 14 months. No partial responses occurred in four patients with tumors with HER2 amplifications. The median overall survival was 9 months from the start of dacomitinib (95% CI 7-21 months) for patients with HER2 mutations and ranged from 5 to 22 months with amplifications. Treatment-related toxicities included diarrhea (90%; grade 3/4: 20%/3%), dermatitis (73%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%), and fatigue (57%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%). One patient died on study likely due to an interaction of dacomitinib with mirtazapine. CONCLUSIONS: Dacomitinib produced objective responses in patients with lung cancers with specific HER2 exon 20 insertions. This observation validates HER2 exon 20 insertions as actionable targets and justifies further study of HER2-targeted agents in specific HER2-driven lung cancers. CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00818441.	B	high	The publication describes a phase II clinical trial involving 30 human patients with lung cancer, providing clinical outcomes and statistical results.

e2f57d30-abed-5093-899e-2cb25e7f9d87	D	The ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor PF-06463922 Overcomes Primary Resistance to Crizotinib in ALK-Driven Neuroblastoma.	UNLABELLED: Neuroblastomas harboring activating point mutations in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are differentially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, with certain mutations conferring intrinsic crizotinib resistance. To overcome this clinical obstacle, our goal was to identify inhibitors with improved potency that can target intractable ALK variants such as F1174L. We find that PF-06463922 has high potency across ALK variants and inhibits ALK more effectively than crizotinib in vitro. Most importantly, PF-06463922 induces complete tumor regression in both crizotinib-resistant and crizotinib-sensitive xenograft mouse models of neuroblastoma, as well as in patient-derived xenografts harboring the crizotinib-resistant F1174L or F1245C mutations. These studies demonstrate that PF-06463922 has the potential to overcome crizotinib resistance and exerts unprecedented activity as a single targeted agent against F1174L and F1245C ALK-mutated xenograft tumors, while also inducing responses in an R1275Q xenograft model. Taken together, these results provide the rationale to move PF-06463922 into clinical trials for treatment of patients with ALK-mutated neuroblastoma. SIGNIFICANCE: The next-generation ALK/ROS1 inhibitor PF-06463922 exerts unparalleled activity in ALK-driven neuroblastoma models with primary crizotinib resistance. Our biochemical and in vivo data provide the preclinical rationale for fast-tracking the development of this agent in children with relapsed/refractory ALK-mutant neuroblastoma.	D	high	The study describes experiments conducted in vitro (cell lines) and in vivo using xenograft mouse models, including patient-derived xenografts. The abstract explicitly states 'Our biochemical and in vivo data provide the preclinical rationale', indicating that this is preclinical evidence and not direct human clinical data.
6c3e6977-e6fa-59d0-b6ca-99a7945071b9	C	Clinicopathological characteristics of 11 NSCLC patients with EGFR-exon 20 mutations.	INTRODUCTION: The characteristics of different types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are not extensively studied. The distribution of EGFR mutations is known, with the most frequent in exon 19 (deletions) or exon 21 (point mutations). Aberrations in exon 18 or 20 are infrequently found. Point mutations in exon 20 confer resistance against tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), whereas the effect of the rare exon 20 insertions is, to a lesser extent, known. We present clinicopathological characteristics of patients with EGFR mutations in the four exons, with emphasis on exon 20 positive patients. METHODS: NSCLC patients who tested positively for EGFR mutations at the Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway in the period between May 2010 and February 2012 were selected. Clinical information was collected for mutated patients, and response information for patients with exon 20 insertions treated with TKI is reported. RESULTS: Of 119 patients with EGFR mutation, 62.2% were women. The median age was 66.0 years. The frequency of exon 18, 19, 20, and 21 was 7%, 45%, 7%, and 38%, respectively. Four patients (3.3%) had double mutations, and exon 20 was involved in three of these. Seven of 11 exon 20 positive patients were treated with TKI. All five single-mutated exon 20 positive TKI-treated patients had progressive disease at first evaluation, whereas both TKI-treated exon 20 involving double-mutated patients had partial response. CONCLUSION: Exon 20 mutations seem to confer insensitivity to TKI treatment.	B	high	The study presents primary patient data from a cohort of 119 NSCLC patients, with a specific focus on 11 patients with EGFR-exon 20 mutations. It reports clinicopathological characteristics and treatment responses for these patients, including statistical results on frequencies and outcomes. This aligns with Level B, which includes 'primary patient data with >5 patients' and 'Has statistical results but less definitive than Level A'.
b544bd80-6b2f-5cfd-8cbf-ba9ab4ec7708	D	Ponatinib inhibits polyclonal drug-resistant KIT oncoproteins and shows therapeutic potential in heavily pretreated gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients.	PURPOSE: KIT is the major oncogenic driver of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib are approved therapies; however, efficacy is often limited by the acquisition of polyclonal secondary resistance mutations in KIT, with those located in the activation (A) loop (exons 17/18) being particularly problematic. Here, we explore the KIT-inhibitory activity of ponatinib in preclinical models and describe initial characterization of its activity in patients with GIST. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cellular and in vivo activities of ponatinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib against mutant KIT were evaluated using an accelerated mutagenesis assay and a panel of engineered and GIST-derived cell lines. The ponatinib-KIT costructure was also determined. The clinical activity of ponatinib was examined in three patients with GIST previously treated with all three FDA-approved agents. RESULTS: In engineered and GIST-derived cell lines, ponatinib potently inhibited KIT exon 11 primary mutants and a range of secondary mutants, including those within the A-loop. Ponatinib also induced regression in engineered and GIST-derived tumor models containing these secondary mutations. In a mutagenesis screen, 40 nmol/L ponatinib was sufficient to suppress outgrowth of all secondary mutants except V654A, which was suppressed at 80 nmol/L. This inhibitory profile could be rationalized on the basis of structural analyses. Ponatinib (30 mg daily) displayed encouraging clinical activity in two of three patients with GIST. CONCLUSION: Ponatinib possesses potent activity against most major clinically relevant KIT mutants and has demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity in patients with refractory GIST. These data strongly support further evaluation of ponatinib in patients with GIST.	C	high	The study includes both preclinical evidence (in vitro and in vivo models) and clinical observations. The clinical component involves a very small patient series (three patients), which falls under the definition of Level C (Case Study: case reports or very small patient series <5 patients). While there is extensive preclinical data (Level D), the inclusion of direct human evidence, even from a limited number of patients, elevates the overall evidence level to C.
31057c1b-c533-542f-bcac-61446de2829c	D	What hides behind the MASC: clinical response and acquired resistance to entrectinib after ETV6-NTRK3 identification in a mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC).	BACKGROUND: Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC) is a recently described pathologic entity. We report the case of a patient with an initial diagnosis of salivary acinic cell carcinoma later reclassified as MASC after next-generation sequencing revealed an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This alteration was targeted with the pan-Trk inhibitor entrectinib (Ignyta), which possesses potent in vitro activity against cell lines containing various NTRK1/2/3 fusions. RESULTS: A dramatic and durable response was achieved with entrectinib in this patient, followed by acquired resistance that correlated with the appearance of a novel NTRK3 G623R mutation. Structural modeling predicts that this alteration sterically interferes with drug binding, correlating to decreased sensitivity to drug inhibition observed in cell-based assays. CONCLUSIONS: This first report of clinical activity with TrkC inhibition and the development of acquired resistance in an NTRK3-rearranged cancer emphasize the utility of comprehensive molecular profiling and targeted therapy for rare malignancies (NCT02097810).	C	high	The abstract explicitly states, 'We report the case of a patient,' indicating this is a single-patient case report. This aligns with the definition of Level C, which includes case reports or very small patient series (<5 patients). While there is also preclinical evidence mentioned, the primary clinical data presented is from a single individual.
8372b753-a39a-5444-8d89-e5db15ca59e2	D	The First-in-class Anti-EGFR Antibody Mixture Sym004 Overcomes Cetuximab Resistance Mediated by EGFR Extracellular Domain Mutations in Colorectal Cancer.	PURPOSE: Approved anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab provide significant clinical benefit in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC). However, patients ultimately develop disease progression, often driven by acquisition of mutations in the extracellular domain (ECD) of EGFR. Sym004 is a novel 1:1 mixture of two nonoverlapping anti-EGFR mAbs that recently showed promising clinical activity in a phase I trial in MCRC. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of Sym004 to circumvent cetuximab resistance driven by EGFR ECD mutations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Functional studies were performed to assess drug-receptor binding as well as ligand-dependent activation of individual EGFR mutants in the presence of cetuximab, panitumumab, and Sym004. Cell viability and molecular effects of the drugs were assayed in cetuximab-resistant cell lines and in tumor xenograft models. Efficacy of Sym004 was evaluated in patients progressing to cetuximab that harbored EGFR mutation in the post-cetuximab tumor sample. RESULTS: Contrary to cetuximab and panitumumab, Sym004 effectively bound and abrogated ligand-induced phosphorylation of all individual EGFR mutants. Cells resistant to cetuximab harboring mutations in EGFR maintained sensitivity to Sym004, which was consistent with an effective suppression of EGFR downstream signaling, translating into profound and sustained tumor regression in the xenograft model. As proof-of-principle, a patient with a tumor harboring an EGFR mutation (G465R) following cetuximab therapy benefited from Sym004 therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Sym004 is an active drug in MCRC resistant to cetuximab/panitumumab mediated by EGFR mutations. EGFR mutations are potential biomarkers of response to Sym004 to be evaluated in ongoing large clinical trials. Clin Cancer Res; 22(13); 3260-7. ©2016 AACR.	C	high	The study primarily presents preclinical evidence from in vitro cell line experiments and in vivo xenograft models. However, it also includes a 'proof-of-principle' observation from a single patient, which qualifies as a case study or a very small patient series (<5 patients).

c79f9744-f086-5dab-a6c2-72e3ae2a8ac1	C	Genomic Correlate of Exceptional Erlotinib Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials demonstrate no benefit for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors in unselected patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, a patient with stage IVA HNSCC received 13 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib and experienced a near-complete histologic response. OBJECTIVE: To determine a mechanism of exceptional response to erlotinib therapy in HNSCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Single patient with locally advanced HNSCC who received erlotinib monotherapy in a window-of-opportunity clinical trial (patients scheduled to undergo primary cancer surgery are treated briefly with an investigational agent). Whole-exome sequencing of pretreatment tumor and germline patient samples was performed at a quaternary care academic medical center, and a candidate somatic variant was experimentally investigated for mediating erlotinib response. INTERVENTION: A brief course of erlotinib monotherapy followed by surgical resection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Identification of pretreatment tumor somatic alterations that may contribute to the exceptional response to erlotinib. Hypotheses were formulated regarding enhanced erlotinib response in preclinical models harboring the patient tumor somatic variant MAPK1 E322K following the identification of tumor somatic variants. RESULTS: No EGFR alterations were observed in the pretreatment tumor DNA. Paradoxically, the tumor harbored an activating MAPK1 E322K mutation (allelic fraction 0.13), which predicts ERK activation and erlotinib resistance in EGFR-mutant lung cancer. The HNSCC cells with MAPK1 E322K exhibited enhanced EGFR phosphorylation and erlotinib sensitivity compared with wild-type MAPK1 cells. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Selective erlotinib use in HNSCC may be informed by precision oncology approaches.	C	high	The study explicitly states that it focuses on a 'Single patient' who experienced an exceptional response to erlotinib. This falls directly under the definition of Level C, which includes 'Case reports or very small patient series (<5 patients)' and 'Often single-patient reports in clinical journals'. While preclinical validation was performed, the primary clinical observation and participant count are limited to one individual.
a68f3465-7a1b-57f2-aebc-a149683f1c47	D	Epidermal growth factor receptor activation in glioblastoma through novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain.	BACKGROUND: Protein tyrosine kinases are important regulators of cellular homeostasis with tightly controlled catalytic activity. Mutations in kinase-encoding genes can relieve the autoinhibitory constraints on kinase activity, can promote malignant transformation, and appear to be a major determinant of response to kinase inhibitor therapy. Missense mutations in the EGFR kinase domain, for example, have recently been identified in patients who showed clinical responses to EGFR kinase inhibitor therapy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Encouraged by the promising clinical activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors in treating glioblastoma in humans, we have sequenced the complete EGFR coding sequence in glioma tumor samples and cell lines. We identified novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain of EGFR in 13.6% (18/132) of glioblastomas and 12.5% (1/8) of glioblastoma cell lines. These EGFR mutations were associated with increased EGFR gene dosage and conferred anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity to NIH-3T3 cells. Cells transformed by expression of these EGFR mutants were sensitive to small-molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest extracellular missense mutations as a novel mechanism for oncogenic EGFR activation and may help identify patients who can benefit from EGFR kinase inhibitors for treatment of glioblastoma.	B	high	The study identified novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain of EGFR in 13.6% (18/132) of glioblastomas. This involves the analysis of primary patient data from a cohort of 132 human tumor samples, which exceeds the >5 patient threshold for Level B. While the study also includes preclinical (in vitro/in vivo) evidence, the direct observation in a significant number of human tumor samples places it in the 'Clinical Evidence' category.
e8aa2c7b-b24e-5d0d-aa0c-b70bf9a5c2ad	C	Rucaparib in relapsed, platinum-sensitive high-grade ovarian carcinoma (ARIEL2 Part 1): an international, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial.	BACKGROUND: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have activity in ovarian carcinomas with homologous recombination deficiency. Along with BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) mutations genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) might also represent homologous recombination deficiency. In ARIEL2, we assessed the ability of tumour genomic LOH, quantified with a next-generation sequencing assay, to predict response to rucaparib, an oral PARP inhibitor. METHODS: ARIEL2 is an international, multicentre, two-part, phase 2, open-label study done at 49 hospitals and cancer centres in Australia, Canada, France, Spain, the UK, and the USA. In ARIEL2 Part 1, patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive, high-grade ovarian carcinoma were classified into one of three predefined homologous recombination deficiency subgroups on the basis of tumour mutational analysis: BRCA mutant (deleterious germline or somatic), BRCA wild-type and LOH high (LOH high group), or BRCA wild-type and LOH low (LOH low group). We prespecified a cutoff of 14% or more genomic LOH for LOH high. Patients began treatment with oral rucaparib at 600 mg twice per day for continuous 28 day cycles until disease progression or any other reason for discontinuation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. All patients treated with at least one dose of rucaparib were included in the safety analyses and all treated patients who were classified were included in the primary endpoint analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01891344. Enrolment into ARIEL2 Part 1 is complete, although an extension (Part 2) is ongoing. FINDINGS: 256 patients were screened and 206 were enrolled between Oct 30, 2013, and Dec 19, 2014. At the data cutoff date (Jan 18, 2016), 204 patients had received rucaparib, with 28 patients remaining in the study. 192 patients could be classified into one of the three predefined homologous recombination deficiency subgroups: BRCA mutant (n=40), LOH high (n=82), or LOH low (n=70). Tumours from 12 patients were established as BRCA wild-type, but could not be classified for LOH, because of insufficient neoplastic nuclei in the sample. The median duration of treatment for the 204 patients was 5·7 months (IQR 2·8-10·1). 24 patients in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 56 patients in the LOH high subgroup, and 59 patients in the LOH low subgroup had disease progression or died. Median progression-free survival after rucaparib treatment was 12·8 months (95% CI 9·0-14·7) in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 5·7 months (5·3-7·6) in the LOH high subgroup, and 5·2 months (3·6-5·5) in the LOH low subgroup. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the BRCA mutant (hazard ratio 0·27, 95% CI 0·16-0·44, p<0·0001) and LOH high (0·62, 0·42-0·90, p=0·011) subgroups compared with the LOH low subgroup. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were anaemia or decreased haemoglobin (45 [22%] patients), and elevations in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (25 [12%]). Common serious adverse events included small intestinal obstruction (10 [5%] of 204 patients), malignant neoplasm progression (10 [5%]), and anaemia (nine [4%]). Three patients died during the study (two because of disease progression and one because of sepsis and disease progression). No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: In patients with BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and LOH high platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinomas treated with rucaparib, progression-free survival was longer than in patients with BRCA wild-type LOH low carcinomas. Our results suggest that assessment of tumour LOH can be used to identify patients with BRCA wild-type platinum-sensitive ovarian cancers who might benefit from rucaparib. These results extend the potential usefulness of PARP inhibitors in the treatment setting beyond BRCA mutant tumours.

PURPOSE: To assess the antitumor activity and safety of tipifarnib, a highly potent and selective farnesyltransferase inhibitor, we performed a phase II clinical trial in patients with advanced and refractory urothelial carcinoma harboring missense <i>HRAS</i> mutations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 245 adult patients with previously treated, advanced urothelial carcinoma entered the molecular screening program including <i>HRAS</i>. Those with missense <i>HRAS</i> mutations or <i>STK11</i>:rs2075606 received oral tipifarnib 900 mg twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21 of 28-day treatment cycles. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6). RESULTS: We identified 16 (7%) missense <i>HRAS</i> mutations (G13R, 7; Q61R, 4; G12S, 3; G12C, 2) and 104 (46%) <i>STK11</i>:rs2075606 carriers. In 21 patients enrolled in the study, 14 and 7 patients had missense <i>HRAS</i> mutations and <i>STK11</i>:rs2075606, respectively. The most frequently observed adverse events included fatigue (86%) and hematologic toxicities. With a median follow-up of 28 months, 4 patients (19%) reached PFS6: 3 had missense <i>HRAS</i> mutations and one patient, enrolled as an <i>STK11</i> carrier, had <i>HRAS</i> frameshift insertions at H27fs and H28fs rendering a nonsense <i>HRAS</i> mutation. The overall response rate by intent-to-treat analysis was 24% (4 missense and one nonsense frameshift HRAS mutation); no response was observed in patients with urothelial carcinoma with wild-type <i>HRAS</i> tumors. Five responses were observed in 12 evaluable patients of 15 with tumors carrying <i>HRAS</i> mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Oral tipifarnib resulted in a manageable safety profile and encouraging antitumor efficacy against treatment-refractory urothelial carcinoma containing <i>HRAS</i> mutations.

b544bd80-6b2f-5cfd-8cbf-ba9ab4ec7708	D	Ponatinib inhibits polyclonal drug-resistant KIT oncoproteins and shows therapeutic potential in heavily pretreated gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients.	PURPOSE: KIT is the major oncogenic driver of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib are approved therapies; however, efficacy is often limited by the acquisition of polyclonal secondary resistance mutations in KIT, with those located in the activation (A) loop (exons 17/18) being particularly problematic. Here, we explore the KIT-inhibitory activity of ponatinib in preclinical models and describe initial characterization of its activity in patients with GIST. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cellular and in vivo activities of ponatinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib against mutant KIT were evaluated using an accelerated mutagenesis assay and a panel of engineered and GIST-derived cell lines. The ponatinib-KIT costructure was also determined. The clinical activity of ponatinib was examined in three patients with GIST previously treated with all three FDA-approved agents. RESULTS: In engineered and GIST-derived cell lines, ponatinib potently inhibited KIT exon 11 primary mutants and a range of secondary mutants, including those within the A-loop. Ponatinib also induced regression in engineered and GIST-derived tumor models containing these secondary mutations. In a mutagenesis screen, 40 nmol/L ponatinib was sufficient to suppress outgrowth of all secondary mutants except V654A, which was suppressed at 80 nmol/L. This inhibitory profile could be rationalized on the basis of structural analyses. Ponatinib (30 mg daily) displayed encouraging clinical activity in two of three patients with GIST. CONCLUSION: Ponatinib possesses potent activity against most major clinically relevant KIT mutants and has demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity in patients with refractory GIST. These data strongly support further evaluation of ponatinib in patients with GIST.	C	high	The study includes both preclinical (in vitro and in vivo models) and clinical data. The clinical component involves a very small patient series of three patients, which falls under the definition of Level C (case reports or very small patient series <5 patients).

a9600b22-c93c-5241-a51e-330faac0cf56	B	Correlation of p53 status with the response to chemotherapy-based treatment in esophageal cancer: a meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: The value of p53 status for predicting response to chemotherapy-based treatment in patients with esophageal cancer has been controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to elucidate the correlation of p53 status with the response to chemotherapy-based treatment. METHODS: Studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science (up to September 2012). The p53 status and response to therapy were defined and standardized. Subgroup analyses based on the treatment and histopathology were performed to explore the usefulness of p53 status for predicting response to therapy in esophageal cancer. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by removing specific studies to assess the effects of study quality. RESULTS: We included 28 studies with 1497 cases in our meta-analysis. Wild-type form of p53 status (low expression of p53 protein and/or wild-type p53 gene) was associated with high response to chemotherapy-based treatment in esophageal cancer (total major response [MR]: risk ratio [RR] = 1.09, 95 % CI = 1.03-1.16, P = .003; pathological MR: RR = 1.15, 95 % CI = 1.06-1.25, P = .001; total complete response [CR]: RR = 1.08, 95 % CI = 1.00-1.17, P = .040). The similar correlation between the wild-type form p53 and response to therapy were also detected in subgroup analyses (total MR, pathological MR, and total CR in chemoradiotherapy subgroup; total MR in chemotherapy subgroup; total MR and pathological CR in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [ESCC]). Additionally, patients with wild-type form p53 status had high pathological complete response rate to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in ESCC. CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis suggested that p53 status might be a predictive biomarker for response to chemotherapy-based treatment in esophageal cancer.

BRAF inhibitors elicit rapid antitumor responses in the majority of patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, but acquired drug resistance is almost universal. We sought to identify the core resistance pathways and the extent of tumor heterogeneity during disease progression. We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase reactivation mechanisms were detected among 70% of disease-progressive tissues, with RAS mutations, mutant BRAF amplification, and alternative splicing being most common. We also detected PI3K-PTEN-AKT-upregulating genetic alterations among 22% of progressive melanomas. Distinct molecular lesions in both core drug escape pathways were commonly detected concurrently in the same tumor or among multiple tumors from the same patient. Beyond harboring extensively heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, melanoma regrowth emerging from BRAF inhibitor selection displayed branched evolution marked by altered mutational spectra/signatures and increased fitness. Thus, melanoma genomic heterogeneity contributes significantly to BRAF inhibitor treatment failure, implying upfront, cotargeting of two core pathways as an essential strategy for durable responses.	B	high	The abstract describes a study analyzing primary patient data from a cohort of melanoma patients undergoing BRAF inhibitor therapy. It presents statistical results, such as '70% of disease-progressive tissues' and '22% of progressive melanomas,' indicating a patient series larger than five, which aligns with the definition of Level B.
62f24922-0cec-54cf-8c98-fd9501b5b01f	C	Dasatinib induces significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase.	Treatment options are limited for patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-AP). Dasatinib is a novel, potent, oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC-family kinases that showed marked efficacy in a phase 1 trial of patients with imatinib-resistant CML. Results are presented for 107 patients with CML-AP with imatinib-resistance or -intolerance from a phase 2, open-label study further evaluating dasatinib efficacy and safety. At 8 months' minimum follow-up, 81%, 64%, and 39% of patients achieved overall, major (MaHR), and complete hematologic responses, respectively, whereas 33% and 24% attained major and complete cytogenetic remission. Of 69 patients who achieved MaHR, 7 progressed. Seventy-six percent of patients are estimated to be alive and progression-free at 10 months. Response rates for the 60% of patients with baseline BCR-ABL mutations did not differ from the total population. Dasatinib was well tolerated: most nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate; no imatinib-intolerant patients discontinued dasatinib because of AEs. Although common (76% of patients with severe neutropenia), cytopenias were manageable through dose modification. In summary, dasatinib induced significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance, was well tolerated, and may represent a potent new therapeutic option for CML-AP. Further follow-up is warranted. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #CA180005.

BACKGROUND: PD-0332991 is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6, and was evaluated to determine its anti-proliferative effects in 25 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of PD-0332991 were determined with cell line proliferation assays, as were its effects on the cell cycle, apoptosis, and retinoblastoma (RB) phosphorylation. Molecular markers for response prediction, including p16, p15, cyclin D1 (CCND1), cyclin E1 (CCNE1), E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1), RB, CDK4 and CDK6, were studied using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and gene expression. RESULTS: IC50 values for PD-0332991 ranged from 25.0 nM to 700 nM, and the agent demonstrated G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest, induction of late apoptosis, and blockade of RB phosphorylation. Through genotype and expression data p16, p15 and E2F1 were identified as having significant association between loss and sensitivity to PD-0332991: p16 (p=0.021), p15 (p=0.047), and E2F1 (p=0.041). CONCLUSION: PD-0332991 has antiproliferative activity in RCC cell lines, and molecular markers predict for sensitivity to this agent.

5a5e703b-2908-50bd-8dca-3618a4fb3ff1	B	PIK3CA mutations in colorectal cancer are associated with clinical resistance to EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies.	The monoclonal antibodies (moAb) panitumumab and cetuximab target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and have proven valuable for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). EGFR-mediated signaling involves two main intracellular cascades: on one side KRAS activates BRAF, which in turn triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinases. On the other, membrane localization of the lipid kinase PIK3CA counteracts PTEN and promotes AKT1 phosphorylation, thereby activating a parallel intracellular axis. Constitutive activation of KRAS bypasses the corresponding signaling cascade and, accordingly, patients with mCRC bearing KRAS mutations are clinically resistant to therapy with panitumumab or cetuximab. We hypothesized that mutations activating PIK3CA could also preclude responsiveness to EGFR-targeted moAbs through a similar mechanism. Here, we present the mutational analysis of PIK3CA and KRAS and evaluation of the PTEN protein status in a cohort of 110 patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR moAbs. We observed 15 (13.6%) PIK3CA and 32 (29.0%) KRAS mutations. PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with clinical resistance to panitumumab or cetuximab; none of the mutated patients achieved objective response (P = 0.038). When only KRAS wild-type tumors were analyzed, the statistical correlation was stronger (P = 0.016). Patients with PIK3CA mutations displayed a worse clinical outcome also in terms of progression-free survival (P = 0.035). Our data indicate that PIK3CA mutations can independently hamper the therapeutic response to panitumumab or cetuximab in mCRC. When the molecular status of the PIK3CA/PTEN and KRAS pathways are concomitantly ascertained, up to 70% of mCRC patients unlikely to respond to EGFR moAbs can be identified.	B	high	The study presents primary patient data from a cohort of 110 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. It includes mutational analysis and evaluation of clinical outcomes, providing statistical results (P-values) demonstrating a significant association between PIK3CA mutations and clinical resistance/worse progression-free survival. This aligns with Level B, which describes clinical trials (Phase I–III) or primary patient data with more than 5 patients and statistical results, but less definitive than Level A.
59a5cab3-7b4f-51ea-819c-54df8ee62e14	D	HER3 as biomarker and therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer: new insights in pertuzumab therapy in preclinical models.	The anti-HER2 antibody pertuzumab inhibits HER2 dimerization and affects HER2/HER3 dimer formation and signaling. As HER3 and its ligand neuregulin are implicated in pancreatic tumorigenesis, we investigated whether HER3 expression could be a predictive biomarker of pertuzumab efficacy in HER2low-expressing pancreatic cancer. We correlated in vitro and in vivo HER3 expression and neuregulin dependency with the inhibitory effect of pertuzumab on cell viability and tumor progression. HER3 knockdown in BxPC-3 cells led to resistance to pertuzumab therapy. Pertuzumab treatment of HER3-expressing pancreatic cancer cells increased HER3 at the cell membrane, whereas the anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody 9F7-F11 down-regulated it. Both antibodies blocked HER3 and AKT phosphorylation and inhibited HER2/HER3 heterodimerization but affected differently HER2 and HER3 homodimers. The pertuzumab/9F7-F11 combination enhanced tumor inhibition and the median survival time in mice xenografted with HER3-expressing pancreatic cancer cells. Finally, HER2 and HER3 were co-expressed in 11% and HER3 alone in 27% of the 45 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas analyzed by immunohistochemistry. HER3 is essential for pertuzumab efficacy in HER2low-expressing pancreatic cancer and HER3 expression might be a predictive biomarker of pertuzumab efficacy in such cancers. Further studies in clinical samples are required to confirm these findings and the interest of combining anti-HER2 and anti-HER3 therapeutic antibodies.	D	high	The study primarily relies on in vitro experiments using cell lines (BxPC-3 cells) and in vivo experiments using mouse xenograft models to investigate the efficacy of pertuzumab and the role of HER3. While there is an analysis of HER2 and HER3 expression in 45 human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, this is an observational biomarker study and not a clinical trial or direct evidence of therapeutic efficacy in human patients. The abstract explicitly states, 'Further studies in clinical samples are required to confirm these findings'.
01b9b6ab-04f0-5f16-a5b3-812a86fbaff0	D	Functional analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and potential implications for EGFR targeted therapy.	PURPOSE: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) might be predictive for clinical response to EGFR inhibitor treatment. However, retrospective analyses of EGFR mutations in clinical trials have shown inconclusive results and the effect of EGFR sequencing in NSCLC is still controversial. Because the vast majority of EGFR mutations described have not been functionally characterized, simple correlation of mutational status and treatment response may not provide reliable information about the predictive value of EGFR mutations. Thus, we aimed to characterize a comprehensive panel of clinically observed EGFR mutations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS: A panel of 30 EGFR mutations was cloned and characterized for kinase activity and the ability to confer growth factor independence. Interestingly, 4 of 30 EGFR mutations showed no kinase activity even after ligand stimulation and were not able to confer growth factor independence. Ba/F3 cells expressing activating EGFR mutants were then used to test the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in a cell proliferation assay. IC(50) values were calculated for gefitinib, erlotinib, and AEE788. We show that the sensitivity of EGFR mutations toward different inhibitors varies significantly, thus establishing a comprehensive sensitivity profile for each inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: EGFR mutations identified in NSCLC patients display distinct biological features. The variability in kinase activity, transforming potential, and sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors has to be considered in clinical studies aiming to correlate mutational status and drug response. The identification of comprehensive drug resistance profiles opens the opportunity to test alternative EGFR inhibitors in vitro.	D	high	The study describes experiments conducted using 'Ba/F3 cells' and 'in vitro' assays to characterize EGFR mutations and test the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors. This aligns with the definition of preclinical evidence, which involves in vitro models and is not direct human evidence.
c5f7bbd4-788f-55d7-9b1e-082fae2b1c0c	D	Antimyeloma activity of bromodomain inhibitors on the human myeloma cell line U266 by downregulation of MYCL.	Bromodomain and extraterminal protein (BET) inhibitors suppress the expression of c-MYC. U266, a human myeloma cell line, expresses the MYCL gene, but not the c-MYC gene. Our aim was to analyse the antimyeloma activity of BET inhibitors on U266 cells. Two BET inhibitors, I-BET151 and JQ1, were tested. U266 cell proliferation decreased to 61.5 and 54.0% of the control after incubation with 500 nmol/l I-BET151 for 72 and 96 h and to 53.5 and 56.4% of control after incubation with 500 nmol/l JQ1 for 72 and 96 h by MTS tetrazolium, respectively. BET inhibitors induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase in U266 cells, but did not induce apoptosis by flow cytometry. According to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, MYC-related genes were significantly downregulated in U266 cells treated with I-BET151 similar to KMS11 cells that expressed c-MYC. The MYCL1 was expressed in U266 cells, whereas c-MYC and MYCN were not by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription-PCR. Incubation with I-BET151 induced downregulation of MYCL1 in U266 cells. BET inhibitors decreased the cell proliferation in U266 cells with overexpression of MYCL less than those without overexpression of MYCL. BET inhibitors induce G1 arrest without apoptosis and interfere with the proliferation of U266 myeloma cells, which express MYCL, but not c-MYC. BET inhibitors might be active in cancers that express MYCL, but not c-MYC.	D	high	The study exclusively uses a human myeloma cell line (U266) to investigate the antimyeloma activity of bromodomain inhibitors.

433b94bf-4d57-58e3-80c0-ae38b825aaf9	A	Afatinib for patients with lung adenocarcinoma and epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (LUX-Lung 2): a phase 2 trial.	BACKGROUND: Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB-family blocker with preclinical activity in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations. We aimed to assess the efficacy of afatinib in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutations. METHODS: In this phase 2 study, we enrolled patients from 30 centres in Taiwan and the USA with lung adenocarcinoma (stage IIIb with pleural effusion or stage IV) with EGFR mutations, who had no more than one previous chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and no previous treatment with EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. We tested two afatinib starting doses: 50 mg daily and subsequently 40 mg daily, introduced to establish whether tolerability could be improved with retention of anti-tumour activity. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a confirmed objective response (complete response or partial response), on the basis of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0 (independent review). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00525148. FINDINGS: 129 patients were treated with afatinib, 99 with a starting dose of 50 mg and 30 with a starting dose of 40 mg. 79 (61%) of 129 patients had an objective response (two complete responses, 77 partial responses). 70 (66%) of the 106 patients with the two common activating EGFR mutations (deletion 19 or L858R) had an objective response, as did nine (39%) of 23 patients with less common mutations. Similar proportions of patients had an objective response when analysed by starting dose (18 [60%] of 30 patients at 40 mg vs 61 [62%] of 99 patients at 50 mg). Of the two most common adverse events (diarrhoea and rash or acne), grade 3 events were more common in patients receiving a 50 mg starting dose (22 [22%] of 99 patients for diarrhoea and 28 [28%] of 99 patients for rash or acne) than they were in those receiving a 40 mg starting dose (two [7%] of 30 patients for both diarrhoea and rash or acne); possibly treatment-related serious adverse events were also less common in patients receiving a 40 mg starting dose (two of 30 patients vs 14 of 99 patients). We recorded one possibly drug-related death (interstitial lung disease). INTERPRETATION: Afatinib shows activity in the treatment of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations, especially in patients with deletion 19 or L858R mutations. The efficacy of afatinib 40 mg should be compared with chemotherapy or other EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors in EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC. FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim Inc.

d0146438-0d6c-5d11-a967-b45bfd535335	B	Prognostic and predictive value of common mutations for treatment response and survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.	BACKGROUND: We address the prognostic and predictive value of KRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF mutations for clinical outcomes in response to active agents in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). METHODS: We determined KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in tumours from 168 patients treated for mCRC at two institutions. All patients received 5-FU-based first-line chemotherapy and treatment outcome was analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were present in 62 (37%), 13 (8%) and 26 (15%) cases, respectively. Multivariate analysis uncovered BRAF mutation as an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival (hazard ratio (HR) 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-7.6). In addition, patients with BRAF-mutant tumours had significantly lower progression-free survival (PFS: HR 4.0, 95% CI 2.2-7.4) than those whose tumors that carried wild-type BRAF. Among 92 patients treated using chemotherapy and cetuximab as salvage therapy, KRAS mutation was associated with lack of response (P=0.002) and shorter PFS (P=0.09). BRAF (P=0.0005) and PIK3CA (P=0.01) mutations also predicted reduced PFS in response to cetuximab salvage therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the potential of mutational profiling to identify CRCs with different natural histories or treatment responses. The adverse significance of BRAF mutation should inform patient selection and stratification in clinical trials.

0408a338-9649-57b6-9999-0137a80bc8a3	C	Targeting HER2 aberrations as actionable drivers in lung cancers: phase II trial of the pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor dacomitinib in patients with HER2-mutant or amplified tumors.	BACKGROUND: HER2 mutations and amplifications have been identified as oncogenic drivers in lung cancers. Dacomitinib, an irreversible inhibitor of HER2, EGFR (HER1), and HER4 tyrosine kinases, has demonstrated activity in cell-line models with HER2 exon 20 insertions or amplifications. Here, we studied dacomitinib in patients with HER2-mutant or amplified lung cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: As a prespecified cohort of a phase II study, we included patients with stage IIIB/IV lung cancers with HER2 mutations or amplification. We gave oral dacomitinib at 30-45 mg daily in 28-day cycles. End points included partial response rate, overall survival, and toxicity. RESULTS: We enrolled 30 patients with HER2-mutant (n = 26, all in exon 20 including 25 insertions and 1 missense mutation) or HER2-amplified lung cancers (n = 4). Three of 26 patients with tumors harboring HER2 exon 20 mutations [12%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2% to 30%] had partial responses lasting 3+, 11, and 14 months. No partial responses occurred in four patients with tumors with HER2 amplifications. The median overall survival was 9 months from the start of dacomitinib (95% CI 7-21 months) for patients with HER2 mutations and ranged from 5 to 22 months with amplifications. Treatment-related toxicities included diarrhea (90%; grade 3/4: 20%/3%), dermatitis (73%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%), and fatigue (57%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%). One patient died on study likely due to an interaction of dacomitinib with mirtazapine. CONCLUSIONS: Dacomitinib produced objective responses in patients with lung cancers with specific HER2 exon 20 insertions. This observation validates HER2 exon 20 insertions as actionable targets and justifies further study of HER2-targeted agents in specific HER2-driven lung cancers. CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00818441.

dfcdbaed-1b39-5c80-a880-56b7445f4506	B	Phosphoinositide-3-kinase catalytic alpha and KRAS mutations are important predictors of resistance to therapy with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.	BACKGROUND: Specific mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are predictive for favorable response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and are associated with a good prognosis. In contrast, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation has been shown to predict poor response to such therapy. Nevertheless, tumor that initially responds to EGFR-TKIs almost inevitably becomes resistant later. Other mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors could involve activating mutations of the other main EGFR effector pathway, i.e., the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/phosphate and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN)/alpha serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT) pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of phosphoinositide-3-kinase catalytic alpha (PIK3CA), EGFR, and KRAS gene mutations in predicting response and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with EGFR-TKIs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 166 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKI with available archival tissue specimens were included. PIK3CA, EGFR, and KRAS mutations were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-based sequencing. RESULTS: EGFR mutation was detected in 25.3% of patients, PIK3CA mutation in 4.1%, and KRAS mutation in 6.7%. PIK3CA mutation correlated with shorter median time to progression (TTP) (p = 0.01) and worse overall survival (OS) (p < 0.001). EGFR mutation (p < 0.0001) correlated with favorable response to TKIs treatment and longer TTP (p < 0.0001). KRAS mutation correlated with progressive disease (p = 0.05) and shorter median TTP (p = 0.003) but not with OS. Cox multivariate analysis including histology and performance status showed that PIK3CA mutation was an independent factor to predict worse OS (p = 0.0001) and shorter TTP (p = 0.03), while KRAS mutation to predict shorter TTP (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: PIK3CA and KRAS mutations seem to be indicators of resistance and poor survival in patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs.

This aligns with Level B, which describes clinical trials or primary patient data with more than 5 patients and statistical results, but is less definitive than Level A.
3f49b91f-edc0-58d9-9063-f27483f7da63	C	Dasatinib in imatinib-resistant Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias.	BACKGROUND: The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is effective in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) leukemias, but relapse occurs, mainly as a result of the outgrowth of leukemic subclones with imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations. We evaluated dasatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor that targets most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Patients with various phases of CML or with Ph-positive ALL who could not tolerate or were resistant to imatinib were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation study. Dasatinib (15 to 240 mg per day) was administered orally in four-week treatment cycles, once or twice daily. RESULTS: A complete hematologic response was achieved in 37 of 40 patients with chronic-phase CML, and major hematologic responses were seen in 31 of 44 patients with accelerated-phase CML, CML with blast crisis, or Ph-positive ALL. In these two phases, the rates of major cytogenetic response were 45 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Responses were maintained in 95 percent of patients with chronic-phase disease and in 82 percent of patients with accelerated-phase disease, with a median follow-up more than 12 months and 5 months, respectively. Nearly all patients with lymphoid blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL had a relapse within six months. Responses occurred among all BCR-ABL genotypes, with the exception of the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to both dasatinib and imatinib in vitro. Myelosuppression was common but not dose-limiting. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib induces hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with CML or Ph-positive ALL who cannot tolerate or are resistant to imatinib. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00064233 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).	B	high	This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial evaluating dasatinib in human patients with CML or Ph-positive ALL.

96154ef4-3541-5c0a-b2a1-20caa06ab00e	B	Relationship between Tumor Biomarkers and Efficacy in EMILIA, a Phase III Study of Trastuzumab Emtansine in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.	PURPOSE: HER2-positive breast cancer is heterogeneous. Some tumors express mutations, like activating PIK3CA mutations or reduced PTEN expression, that negatively correlate with response to HER2-targeted therapies. In this exploratory analysis, we investigated whether the efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate comprised of the cytotoxic agent DM1 linked to the HER2-targeted antibody trastuzumab, was correlated with the expression of specific biomarkers in the phase III EMILIA study. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumors were evaluated for HER2 (n = 866), EGFR (n = 832), and HER3 (n = 860) mRNA expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR; for PTEN protein expression (n = 271) by IHC; and for PIK3CA mutations (n = 259) using a mutation detection kit. Survival outcomes were analyzed by biomarker subgroups. T-DM1 was also tested on cell lines and in breast cancer xenograft models containing PIK3CA mutations. RESULTS: Longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed with T-DM1 compared with capecitabine plus lapatinib in all biomarker subgroups. PIK3CA mutations were associated with shorter median PFS (mutant vs. wild type: 4.3 vs. 6.4 months) and OS (17.3 vs. 27.8 months) in capecitabine plus lapatinib-treated patients, but not in T-DM1-treated patients (PFS, 10.9 vs. 9.8 months; OS, not reached in mutant or wild type). T-DM1 showed potent activity in cell lines and xenograft models with PIK3CA mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Although other standard HER2-directed therapies are less effective in tumors with PI3KCA mutations, T-DM1 appears to be effective in both PI3KCA-mutated and wild-type tumors.

It uses primary patient data from a large cohort (n=866 for HER2) and provides statistical results for survival outcomes in biomarker subgroups. While it leverages data from a Phase III study, it is an exploratory analysis rather than the primary outcome of the trial, making it strong clinical evidence but less definitive than a Level A 'validated association' or 'practice-changing' evidence. The inclusion of preclinical data (cell lines, xenografts) supports the findings but the primary evidence comes from the human clinical trial data.
c1969d3b-d59b-5172-8da1-58c70df0b809	B	Trastuzumab emtansine for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate incorporating the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted antitumor properties of trastuzumab with the cytotoxic activity of the microtubule-inhibitory agent DM1. The antibody and the cytotoxic agent are conjugated by means of a stable linker. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, who had previously been treated with trastuzumab and a taxane, to T-DM1 or lapatinib plus capecitabine. The primary end points were progression-free survival (as assessed by independent review), overall survival, and safety. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (investigator-assessed), the objective response rate, and the time to symptom progression. Two interim analyses of overall survival were conducted. RESULTS: Among 991 randomly assigned patients, median progression-free survival as assessed by independent review was 9.6 months with T-DM1 versus 6.4 months with lapatinib plus capecitabine (hazard ratio for progression or death from any cause, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.77; P<0.001), and median overall survival at the second interim analysis crossed the stopping boundary for efficacy (30.9 months vs. 25.1 months; hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.85; P<0.001). The objective response rate was higher with T-DM1 (43.6%, vs. 30.8% with lapatinib plus capecitabine; P<0.001); results for all additional secondary end points favored T-DM1. Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were higher with lapatinib plus capecitabine than with T-DM1 (57% vs. 41%). The incidences of thrombocytopenia and increased serum aminotransferase levels were higher with T-DM1, whereas the incidences of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia were higher with lapatinib plus capecitabine. CONCLUSIONS: T-DM1 significantly prolonged progression-free and overall survival with less toxicity than lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane.

3c5a2b2e-1bc2-5b1c-bffe-6e31a0cce2ec	B	Efficacy and safety of regorafenib for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours after failure of imatinib and sunitinib (GRID): an international, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.	BACKGROUND: Until now, only imatinib and sunitinib have proven clinical benefit in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), but almost all metastatic GIST eventually develop resistance to these agents, resulting in fatal disease progression. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of regorafenib in patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST progressing after failure of at least imatinib and sunitinib. METHODS: We did this phase 3 trial at 57 hospitals in 17 countries. Patients with histologically confirmed, metastatic or unresectable GIST, with failure of at least previous imatinib and sunitinib were randomised in a 2:1 ratio (by computer-generated randomisation list and interactive voice response system; preallocated block design (block size 12); stratified by treatment line and geographical region) to receive either oral regorafenib 160 mg daily or placebo, plus best supportive care in both groups, for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle. The study sponsor, participants, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). At disease progression, patients assigned placebo could crossover to open-label regorafenib. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01271712. RESULTS: From Jan 4, to Aug 18, 2011, 240 patients were screened and 199 were randomised to receive regorafenib (n=133) or matching placebo (n=66). Data cutoff was Jan 26, 2012. Median PFS per independent blinded central review was 4·8 months (IQR 1·4-9·2) for regorafenib and 0·9 months (0·9-1·8) for placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·27, 95% CI 0·19-0·39; p<0·0001). After progression, 56 patients (85%) assigned placebo crossed over to regorafenib. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 130 (98%) patients assigned regorafenib and 45 (68%) patients assigned placebo. The most common regorafenib-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were hypertension (31 of 132, 23%), hand-foot skin reaction (26 of 132, 20%), and diarrhoea (seven of 132, 5%). INTERPRETATION: The results of this study show that oral regorafenib can provide a significant improvement in progression-free survival compared with placebo in patients with metastatic GIST after progression on standard treatments. As far as we are aware, this is the first clinical trial to show benefit from a kinase inhibitor in this highly refractory population of patients. FUNDING: Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals.

b544bd80-6b2f-5cfd-8cbf-ba9ab4ec7708	D	Ponatinib inhibits polyclonal drug-resistant KIT oncoproteins and shows therapeutic potential in heavily pretreated gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients.	PURPOSE: KIT is the major oncogenic driver of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib are approved therapies; however, efficacy is often limited by the acquisition of polyclonal secondary resistance mutations in KIT, with those located in the activation (A) loop (exons 17/18) being particularly problematic. Here, we explore the KIT-inhibitory activity of ponatinib in preclinical models and describe initial characterization of its activity in patients with GIST. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cellular and in vivo activities of ponatinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib against mutant KIT were evaluated using an accelerated mutagenesis assay and a panel of engineered and GIST-derived cell lines. The ponatinib-KIT costructure was also determined. The clinical activity of ponatinib was examined in three patients with GIST previously treated with all three FDA-approved agents. RESULTS: In engineered and GIST-derived cell lines, ponatinib potently inhibited KIT exon 11 primary mutants and a range of secondary mutants, including those within the A-loop. Ponatinib also induced regression in engineered and GIST-derived tumor models containing these secondary mutations. In a mutagenesis screen, 40 nmol/L ponatinib was sufficient to suppress outgrowth of all secondary mutants except V654A, which was suppressed at 80 nmol/L. This inhibitory profile could be rationalized on the basis of structural analyses. Ponatinib (30 mg daily) displayed encouraging clinical activity in two of three patients with GIST. CONCLUSION: Ponatinib possesses potent activity against most major clinically relevant KIT mutants and has demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity in patients with refractory GIST. These data strongly support further evaluation of ponatinib in patients with GIST.	C	high	The study includes both preclinical (in vitro and in vivo models) and clinical data. The clinical component involves a very small patient series (three patients), which falls under the definition of Level C (Case Study: case reports or very small patient series <5 patients). While there is also preclinical evidence (Level D), the presence of direct human data, even if limited, places it at Level C.
17472af6-6c74-58b7-8fb7-3a68d915c35d	B	Improved overall survival in melanoma with combined dabrafenib and trametinib.	BACKGROUND: The BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib have shown efficacy as monotherapies in patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. Combining dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib, as compared with dabrafenib alone, enhanced antitumor activity in this population of patients. METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 704 patients with metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation to receive either a combination of dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg once daily) or vemurafenib (960 mg twice daily) orally as first-line therapy. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: At the preplanned interim overall survival analysis, which was performed after 77% of the total number of expected events occurred, the overall survival rate at 12 months was 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67 to 77) in the combination-therapy group and 65% (95% CI, 59 to 70) in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio for death in the combination-therapy group, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.89; P=0.005). The prespecified interim stopping boundary was crossed, and the study was stopped for efficacy in July 2014. Median progression-free survival was 11.4 months in the combination-therapy group and 7.3 months in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.69; P<0.001). The objective response rate was 64% in the combination-therapy group and 51% in the vemurafenib group (P<0.001). Rates of severe adverse events and study-drug discontinuations were similar in the two groups. Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma and keratoacanthoma occurred in 1% of patients in the combination-therapy group and 18% of those in the vemurafenib group. CONCLUSIONS: Dabrafenib plus trametinib, as compared with vemurafenib monotherapy, significantly improved overall survival in previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations, without increased overall toxicity. (Funded by GlaxoSmithKline; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01597908.).

d667db74-efa5-5b46-8da0-40f90a86415d	D	Combining lapatinib (GW572016), a small molecule inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases, with therapeutic anti-ErbB2 antibodies enhances apoptosis of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.	Antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting ErbB2 exhibit distinct, noncross resistant mechanisms of action. Here, apoptosis of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells was enhanced by combining lapatinib, an inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases, with anti-ErbB2 antibodies, including (i) trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, and (ii) pAb, rabbit polyclonal antisera generated by vaccination with a human ErbB2 fusion protein. Treating ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines with a relatively low concentration of lapatinib alone resulted in a minimal increase in tumor cell apoptosis with an associated decrease in steady-state protein levels of p-ErbB2, p-Akt, p-Erk1/2, and notably survivin, compared to baseline. Exposure to pAb alone reduced total ErbB2 protein, disrupting ErbB3 transactivation, leading to a marked inhibition of p-Akt; however, survivin protein levels remained unchanged and apoptosis only increased slightly. Treatment with trastuzumab alone had relatively little effect on survivin and apoptosis was unaffected. Combining lapatinib with either pAb or trastuzumab markedly downregulated survivin protein and enhanced tumor cell apoptosis. The association between the inhibition of survivin and enhanced apoptosis following the combination of ErbB2-targeted therapies provides a biological effect in order to identify therapeutic strategies that promote tumor cell apoptosis and might improve clinical response.	D	high	The abstract explicitly states that the experiments were conducted on 'ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines,' which classifies this as an in vitro preclinical study.
d0146438-0d6c-5d11-a967-b45bfd535335	B	Prognostic and predictive value of common mutations for treatment response and survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.	BACKGROUND: We address the prognostic and predictive value of KRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF mutations for clinical outcomes in response to active agents in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). METHODS: We determined KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in tumours from 168 patients treated for mCRC at two institutions. All patients received 5-FU-based first-line chemotherapy and treatment outcome was analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were present in 62 (37%), 13 (8%) and 26 (15%) cases, respectively. Multivariate analysis uncovered BRAF mutation as an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival (hazard ratio (HR) 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-7.6). In addition, patients with BRAF-mutant tumours had significantly lower progression-free survival (PFS: HR 4.0, 95% CI 2.2-7.4) than those whose tumors that carried wild-type BRAF. Among 92 patients treated using chemotherapy and cetuximab as salvage therapy, KRAS mutation was associated with lack of response (P=0.002) and shorter PFS (P=0.09). BRAF (P=0.0005) and PIK3CA (P=0.01) mutations also predicted reduced PFS in response to cetuximab salvage therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the potential of mutational profiling to identify CRCs with different natural histories or treatment responses. The adverse significance of BRAF mutation should inform patient selection and stratification in clinical trials.	B	high	The study involves a retrospective analysis of primary patient data from 168 human patients, which is well above the 5-patient threshold for Level B.

Treatment options are limited for patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-AP). Dasatinib is a novel, potent, oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC-family kinases that showed marked efficacy in a phase 1 trial of patients with imatinib-resistant CML. Results are presented for 107 patients with CML-AP with imatinib-resistance or -intolerance from a phase 2, open-label study further evaluating dasatinib efficacy and safety. At 8 months' minimum follow-up, 81%, 64%, and 39% of patients achieved overall, major (MaHR), and complete hematologic responses, respectively, whereas 33% and 24% attained major and complete cytogenetic remission. Of 69 patients who achieved MaHR, 7 progressed. Seventy-six percent of patients are estimated to be alive and progression-free at 10 months. Response rates for the 60% of patients with baseline BCR-ABL mutations did not differ from the total population. Dasatinib was well tolerated: most nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate; no imatinib-intolerant patients discontinued dasatinib because of AEs. Although common (76% of patients with severe neutropenia), cytopenias were manageable through dose modification. In summary, dasatinib induced significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance, was well tolerated, and may represent a potent new therapeutic option for CML-AP.

082fd309-b4db-5545-ae54-c104491aec2f	D	Induction of p53-dependent senescence by the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3a in mouse cells of fibroblast origin.	Cellular senescence is emerging as an important in vivo anticancer response elicited by multiple stresses, including currently used chemotherapeutic drugs. Nutlin-3a is a recently discovered small-molecule antagonist of the p53-destabilizing protein murine double minute-2 (MDM2) that induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells with functional p53. Here, we report that nutlin-3a induces cellular senescence in murine primary fibroblasts, oncogenically transformed fibroblasts, and fibrosarcoma cell lines. No evidence of drug-induced apoptosis was observed in any case. Nutlin-induced senescence was strictly dependent on the presence of functional p53 as revealed by the fact that cells lacking p53 were completely insensitive to the drug, whereas cells lacking the tumor suppressor alternative reading frame product of the CDKN2A locus underwent irreversible cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, irreversibility was achieved in neoplastic cells faster than in their corresponding parental primary cells, suggesting that nutlin-3a and oncogenic signaling cooperate in activating p53. Our current results suggest that senescence could be a major cellular outcome of cancer therapy by antagonists of the p53-MDM2 interaction, such as nutlin-3a.	D	high	The study investigates the effects of nutlin-3a on 'murine primary fibroblasts, oncogenically transformed fibroblasts, and fibrosarcoma cell lines'.

1ed9295e-26f5-50a9-b494-1eed770c84fc	B	Genome sequencing identifies a basis for everolimus sensitivity.	Cancer drugs often induce dramatic responses in a small minority of patients. We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the genetic basis of a durable remission of metastatic bladder cancer in a patient treated with everolimus, a drug that inhibits the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway. Among the somatic mutations was a loss-of-function mutation in TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1), a regulator of mTOR pathway activation. Targeted sequencing revealed TSC1 mutations in about 8% of 109 additional bladder cancers examined, and TSC1 mutation correlated with everolimus sensitivity. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using whole-genome sequencing in the clinical setting to identify previously occult biomarkers of drug sensitivity that can aid in the identification of patients most likely to respond to targeted anticancer drugs.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from 109 additional bladder cancers, which is well over 5 patients, demonstrating a correlation between TSC1 mutation and everolimus sensitivity.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by a poor response to treatment and prognosis. Constitutive activation of different signaling pathways in subsets of MCLs, through genetic and/or nongenetic alterations, endows tumor cells with enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The canonical Wnt pathway (β-catenin/TCF-LEF), implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers, is constitutively active in half of MCLs. Here, we show that ZEB1, a transcription factor better known for promoting metastasis in carcinomas, is expressed in primary MCLs with active Wnt signaling. ZEB1 expression in MCL cells depends on Wnt, being downregulated by β-catenin knockdown or blocking of Wnt signaling by salinomycin. Knockdown of ZEB1 reduces in vitro cell viability and proliferation in MCL cells, and, importantly, tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. ZEB1 activates proliferation-associated (HMGB2, UHRF1, CENPF, MYC, MKI67, and CCND1) and anti-apoptotic (MCL1, BCL2, and BIRC5) genes and inhibits pro-apoptotic ones (TP53, BBC3, PMAIP1, and BAX). We show that ZEB1 expression in MCL cells determines differential resistance to chemotherapy drugs and regulates transporters involved in drug influx/efflux. Downregulation of ZEB1 by salinomycin increases the sensitivity of MCL cells to the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin, cytarabine and gemcitabine. Lastly, salinomycin and doxorubicin display a synergistic effect in established and primary MCL cells. These results identify ZEB1 in MCL where it promotes cell proliferation, enhanced tumor growth and a differential response to chemotherapy drugs. ZEB1 could thus potentially become a predictive biomarker and therapeutic target in this lymphoma.

While 'primary MCLs' and 'primary MCL cells' are mentioned, these are used for expression analysis and ex vivo drug synergy experiments, not as part of a clinical trial or patient cohort study with clinical outcomes. This aligns with the definition of preclinical evidence.
d786ddfe-1184-5244-81ea-0f956df63956	C	Targeted therapy by combined inhibition of the RAF and mTOR kinases in malignant spindle cell neoplasm harboring the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion protein.	BACKGROUND: Oncologic patients who are extreme responders to molecularly targeted therapy provide an important opportunity to better understand the biologic basis of response and, in turn, inform clinical decision making. Malignant neoplasms with an uncertain histologic and immunohistochemical characterization present challenges both on initial diagnostic workups and then later in management, as current treatment algorithms are based on a morphologic diagnosis. Herein, we report a case of a difficult to characterize sarcoma-like lesion for which genomic profiling with clinical next generation sequencing (NGS) identified the molecular underpinnings of arrested progression(stable disease) under combination targeted therapy within a phase I clinical trial. METHODS: Genomic profiling with clinical next generation sequencing was performed on the FoundationOne™ platform (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge MA). Histopathology and immunohistochemical studies were performed in the Department of Pathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). Treatment was administered in the context of a phase I clinical trial ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: (NCT01187199). RESULTS: The histology of the tumor was that of a spindle cell neoplasm, grade 2 by FNCLCC standards. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for S100 and CD34. Genomic profiling identified the following alterations: a KIAA1549-BRAF gene fusion resulting from a tandem duplication event, a homozygous deletion of PTEN, and frameshift insertion/deletions in CDKN2A A68fs*51, SUFU E283fs*3, and MAP3K1 N325fs*3. The patient had a 25% reduction in tumor (RECIST v1.1) following combination therapy consisting of sorafenib, temsirolimus, and bevazicumab within a phase I clinical trial. CONCLUSIONS: The patient responded to combination targeted therapy that fortuitously targeted KIAA1549-BRAF and PTEN loss within a spindle cell neoplasm, as revealed by genomic profiling based on NGS. This is the first report of a tumor driven by a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion responding to sorafenib-based combination therapy.

569287c5-43a7-5fd5-9446-4d40c50c2342	D	BRAF fusions define a distinct molecular subset of melanomas with potential sensitivity to MEK inhibition.	"PURPOSE: Recurrent ""driver"" mutations at specific loci in BRAF, NRAS, KIT, GNAQ, and GNA11 define clinically relevant molecular subsets of melanoma, but more than 30% are ""pan-negative"" for these recurrent mutations. We sought to identify additional potential drivers in ""pan-negative"" melanoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay (FoundationOne™) and targeted RNA sequencing, we identified a novel PAPSS1-BRAF fusion in a ""pan-negative"" melanoma. We then analyzed NGS data from 51 additional melanomas genotyped by FoundationOne™, as well as melanoma RNA, whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), to determine the potential frequency of BRAF fusions in melanoma. We characterized the signaling properties of confirmed molecular alterations by ectopic expression of engineered cDNAs in 293H cells. RESULTS: Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in cells by ectopic expression of PAPSS1-BRAF was abrogated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition but not by BRAF inhibition. NGS data analysis of 51 additional melanomas revealed a second BRAF fusion (TRIM24-BRAF) in a ""pan-negative"" sample; MAPK signaling induced by TRIM24-BRAF was also MEK inhibitor sensitive. Through mining TCGA skin cutaneous melanoma dataset, we further identified two potential BRAF fusions in another 49 ""pan-negative"" cases. CONCLUSIONS: BRAF fusions define a new molecular subset of melanoma, potentially comprising 4% to 8% of ""pan-negative"" cases. Their presence may explain an unexpected clinical response to MEK inhibitor therapy or assist in selecting patients for MEK-directed therapy."

b3e8ecdc-a09d-553d-80a6-2f5974fb5c17	D	Crenolanib inhibits the drug-resistant PDGFRA D842V mutation associated with imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors.	PURPOSE: To determine the potential of crenolanib, a potent inhibitor of PDGFRA, to treat malignancies driven by mutant PDGFRA. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The biochemical activity of crenolanib was compared with imatinib using a panel of PDGFRA-mutant kinases expressed in several different cell line models, including primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) cells. The antiproliferative activity of crenolanib was also studied in several cell lines with PDGFRA-dependent growth. RESULTS: Crenolanib was significantly more potent than imatinib in inhibiting the kinase activity of imatinib-resistant PDGFRA kinases (D842I, D842V, D842Y, DI842-843IM, and deletion I843). For example, crenolanib was 135-fold more potent than imatinib against D842V in our isogenic model system, with an IC(50) of approximately 10 nmol/L. The relative potency of crenolanib was further confirmed in BaF3 and primary GIST cells expressing PDGFRA D842V. In contrast, imatinib was at least 10-fold more potent than crenolanib in inhibiting the V561D mutation. For all other tested PDGFRA mutations, crenolanib and imatinib had comparable potency. CONCLUSIONS: Crenolanib is a potent inhibitor of imatinib-resistant PDGFRA kinases associated with GIST, including the PDGFRA D842V mutation found in approximately 5% of GISTs. The spectrum of activity of crenolanib suggests that this drug is a type I inhibitor (inhibitor of activated conformation of kinase). Based in part on these results, a phase II clinical study of this agent to treat GIST with the PDGFRA D842V mutation has been initiated.	D	high	The study describes experiments conducted using 'cell line models' and 'primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) cells' to evaluate the biochemical and antiproliferative activity of crenolanib.

51ae0ab8-56f8-5150-9a99-ae7522c31fd2	C	Mutations of KRAS/NRAS/BRAF predict cetuximab resistance in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.	Approximately 45% of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with wild-type KRAS exon 2 are resistant to cetuximab treatment. We set out to identify additional genetic markers that might predict the response to cetuximab treatment. Fifty-three wild-type KRAS exon 2 mCRC patients were treated with cetuximab/irinotecan-based chemotherapy as a first- or third-line therapy. The mutational statuses of 10 EGFR pathway genes were analyzed in primary tumors using next-generation sequencing. BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS (exons 3 and 4), NRAS, PTEN, and AKT1 mutations were detected in 6, 6, 5, 4, 1, and 1 patient, respectively. Four of the BRAF mutations were non-V600 variants. Four tumors harbored multiple co-existing (complex) mutations. All patients with BRAF mutations or complex mutation patterns were cetuximab non-responders. All patients but one harboring KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutations were non-responders. Mutations in any one of these three genes were associated with a poor response rate (7.1%) and reduced survival (PFS = 8.0 months) compared to wild-type patients (74.4% and 11.6 months). Our data suggest that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations predict response to cetuximab treatment in mCRC patients.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from 53 metastatic colorectal cancer patients, which is greater than 5.

1a0a8f22-0808-5cf8-89d8-647b1bd7709c	B	Effects of KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab plus chemotherapy in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective consortium analysis.	BACKGROUND: Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. METHODS: 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. FINDINGS: 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. INTERPRETATION: While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.

bb43b4a7-31b5-53c5-9825-0c6daa97d177	D	Efficacy of the combination of MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo in KRAS mutant colorectal cancer models.	PURPOSE: Though the efficacy of MEK inhibitors is being investigated in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancers (CRC), early clinical trials of MEK inhibitor monotherapy did not reveal significant antitumor activity. Resistance to MEK inhibitor monotherapy developed through a variety of mechanisms converging in ERK reactivation. Since ERK increases cyclin D expression and increases entry into the cell cycle, we hypothesized that the combination of MEK inhibitors and CDK4/6 inhibitors would have synergistic antitumor activity and cause tumor regression in vivo. RESULTS: The combination of MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors synergistically inhibited cancer cell growth in vitro and caused tumor regression in vivo in cell line and patient-derived xenograft models. Combination therapy markedly decreased levels of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 both in vitro and in vivo and decreased Ki67 staining in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed in vitro proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis, and senescence assays, and Western blots, on a panel of 11 KRAS mutant CRC cell lines treated with the MEK inhibitor MEK162, the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, or the combination. We also treated 4 KRAS mutant CRC cell line and patient-derived xenografts with the MEK inhibitor trametinib, the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, or the combination, and performed immunohistochemical and reverse phase protein array analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Combined inhibition of both MEK and CDK4/6 is effective in preclinical models of KRAS mutant CRC and justifies a planned phase II clinical trial in patients with refractory KRAS-mutant CRC.Efficacy of the combination of MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo in KRAS mutant colorectal cancer models.

Since the prognosis of advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains poor with traditional chemotherapy, attention has shifted to molecularly targeted agents. Results of available clinical studies reveal little or no benefit of using targeted agents in advanced CCA. Limitations of these trials could be the lack of comprehensive molecular and genetic characterization of CCA samples in order to identify potential drug targets. Here we report a case of a 59-year-old female with chemotherapy-refractor, metastatic extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCCA). After failure of first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin plus gemcitabine, next generation sequencing (NGS) based tumor molecular profiling was performed on aspiration cytological sample, that revealed BRAF V600E mutation. Multidisciplinary team decided on the initiation of combined treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Dabrafenib was started orally 150 mg twice a day, adding trametinib 2 mg once a day. Right from the initiation of targeted therapy, significant clinical improvement had been observed. Even though the first restaging computed tomography (CT) scan at 8 weeks revealed spectacular decrease in all metastatic sites, a new hepatic mass of 67 mm × 40 mm was identified and interpreted as new metastatic lesion. As the clinical and radiological response was contradictory, CT-guided biopsy was taken from the hepatic lesion while the therapy was continued on. Histopathologic evaluation excluded the hepatic lesion from being a metastasis, instead described it as a fibrotic, inflammatory lesion. At 12 week, PET CT confirmed further tumor regression with complete regression of the multiple cerebral metastases. The therapy has been extremely well tolerated by the patient. According to our knowledge, this is the first reported case on a successful treatment of EHCCA with the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib. Our case highlights the importance of molecular profiling in CCA, in order to find potential actionable driver mutations for personalised treatment.

4220ad4b-0eb6-5a3f-acd6-54fa3c0b2e73	B	A single-arm phase II Austrian/German multicenter trial on continuous daily sunitinib in primary glioblastoma at first recurrence (SURGE 01-07).	BACKGROUND: Due to the redundancy of molecular pathways simultaneously involved in glioblastoma growth and angiogenesis, therapeutic approaches intervening at multiple levels seem particularly appealing. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, single-arm phase II trial was designed to evaluate the antitumor activity of sunitinib, an oral small-molecule inhibitor of several receptor tyrosine kinases, in patients with first recurrence of primary glioblastoma using a continuous once-daily dosing regimen. Patients received a starting dose of sunitinib 37.5 mg, followed by a maintenance dose between 12.5 mg and 50 mg depending on drug tolerability. The primary endpoint was a 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate. Secondary endpoints included median PFS, overall survival (OS), safety/toxicity, quality of life, and translational studies on the expression of sunitinib target molecules. RESULTS: Forty participants were included in this study, and no objective responses were detected. PFS6 was 12.5%, median PFS 2.2 months, and median OS 9.2 months. Five participants (12.5%) showed prolonged stable disease ≥6 months with a median PFS of 16.0 months (range, 6.4-41.4 mo) and a median OS of 46.9 months (range, 21.2-49.2 mo) for this subgroup. c-KIT expression in vascular endothelial cells (n = 14 participants) was associated with improved PFS. The most common toxicities were fatigue/asthenia, mucositis/dermatitis, dysesthesias, gastrointestinal symptoms, cognitive impairment, leukoctopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Two participants (5%) terminated treatment due to toxicity. CONCLUSION: Continuous daily sunitinib showed minimal antiglioblastoma activity and substantial toxicity when given at higher doses. High endothelial c-KIT expression may define a subgroup of patients who will benefit from sunitinib treatment by achieving prolonged PFS. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00535379.

21aff0e2-714e-50e5-8cfc-df65b38d08c3	B	MEK162 for patients with advanced melanoma harbouring NRAS or Val600 BRAF mutations: a non-randomised, open-label phase 2 study.	BACKGROUND: Patients with melanoma harbouring Val600 BRAF mutations benefit from treatment with BRAF inhibitors. However, no targeted treatments exist for patients with BRAF wild-type tumours, including those with NRAS mutations. We aimed to assess the use of MEK162, a small-molecule MEK1/2 inhibitor, in patients with NRAS-mutated or Val600 BRAF-mutated advanced melanoma. METHODS: In our open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 study, we assigned patients with NRAS-mutated or BRAF-mutated advanced melanoma to one of three treatment arms on the basis of mutation status. Patients were enrolled at university hospitals or private cancer centres in Europe and the USA. The three arms were: twice-daily MEK162 45 mg for NRAS-mutated melanoma, twice-daily MEK162 45 mg for BRAF-mutated melanoma, and twice-daily MEK162 60 mg for BRAF-mutated melanoma. Previous treatment with BRAF inhibitors was permitted, but previous MEK inhibitor therapy was not allowed. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who had an objective response (ie, a complete response or confirmed partial response). We report data for the 45 mg groups. We assessed clinical activity in all patients who received at least one dose of MEK162 and in patients assessable for response (with two available CT scans). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01320085, and is currently recruiting additional patients with NRAS mutations (based on a protocol amendment). FINDINGS: Between March 31, 2011, and Jan 17, 2012, we enrolled 71 patients who received at least one dose of MEK162 45 mg. By Feb 29, 2012 (data cutoff), median follow-up was 3·3 months (range 0·6-8·7; IQR 2·2-5·0). No patients had a complete response. Six (20%) of 30 patients with NRAS-mutated melanoma had a partial response (three confirmed) as did eight (20%) of 41 patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma (two confirmed). The most frequent adverse events were acneiform dermatitis (18 [60%] patients with NRAS -mutated melanoma and 15 [37%] patients with the BRAF-mutated melanoma), rash (six [20%] and 16 [39%]), peripheral oedema (ten [33%] and 14 [34%]), facial oedema (nine [30%] and seven [17%]), diarrhoea (eight [27%] and 15 [37%]), and creatine phosphokinase increases (11 [37%] and nine [22%]). Increased creatine phosphokinase was the most common grade 3-4 adverse event (seven [23%] and seven [17%]). Four patients had serious adverse events (two per arm), which included diarrhoea, dehydration, acneiform dermatitis, general physical deterioration, irregular heart rate, malaise, and small intestinal perforation. No deaths occurred from treatment-related causes. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, MEK162 is the first targeted therapy to show activity in patients with NRAS -mutated melanoma and might offer a new option for a cancer with few effective treatments.

Relapse is the leading cause of mortality in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Among chemotherapeutics, thiopurines are key drugs in ALL combination therapy. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified relapse-specific mutations in the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 gene (PRPS1), which encodes a rate-limiting purine biosynthesis enzyme, in 24/358 (6.7%) relapsed childhood B cell ALL (B-ALL) cases. All individuals who harbored PRPS1 mutations relapsed early during treatment, and mutated ALL clones expanded exponentially before clinical relapse. Our functional analyses of PRPS1 mutants uncovered a new chemotherapy-resistance mechanism involving reduced feedback inhibition of de novo purine biosynthesis and competitive inhibition of thiopurine activation. Notably, the de novo purine synthesis inhibitor lometrexol effectively abrogated PRPS1 mutant-driven drug resistance. These results highlight the importance of constitutive activation of the de novo purine synthesis pathway in thiopurine resistance, and they offer therapeutic strategies for the treatment of relapsed and thiopurine-resistant ALL.

4d1abbcb-2018-541f-813e-7946c916f58a	C	Clinical response to larotrectinib in adult Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL with cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 rearrangement.	Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a subtype of Ph-negative ALL that molecularly resembles Ph-positive ALL. It shares the adverse prognosis of Ph-positive ALL, but lacks the BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene. Instead, Ph-like ALL is associated with alternative mutations in signaling pathways. We describe a case of Ph-like ALL that harbored 2 genomic alterations, which activated signaling, an NRASGly12Asp mutation, and an ETV6-NTRK3 rearrangement. Initially, the NRAS mutation was detected at high frequency, whereas the gene fusion was only detectable with a targeted next-generation sequencing-based fusion assay, but not by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. The disease failed to respond to multiagent chemotherapy but investigational CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy resulted in a complete remission. However, the leukemia relapsed after 6 weeks. Intriguingly, the NRAS mutation was extinguished during the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and did not contribute to the relapse, which was instead associated with a rise in ETV6-NTRK3. The relapsed leukemia progressed with further chemo- and immunotherapy but was controlled for 6 weeks with substantial leukemic cytoreduction using the TRK inhibitor larotrectinib. Unfortunately, recovery of normal hematopoiesis was only marginal and the patient eventually succumbed to infections. These results demonstrate that larotrectinib has clinical activity in ETV6-NTRK3-associated Ph-like ALL.

This aligns with the definition of a Level C evidence, which includes case reports or very small patient series (<5 patients).
01671366-9fb6-5b2c-8de8-5b166a07efee	D	A novel tankyrase inhibitor decreases canonical Wnt signaling in colon carcinoma cells and reduces tumor growth in conditional APC mutant mice.	Increased nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, a mediator of canonical Wnt signaling, is found in numerous tumors and is frequently associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling therefore is an attractive strategy for anticancer drugs. In this study, we have identified a novel small molecule inhibitor of the β-catenin signaling pathway, JW55, that functions via inhibition of the PARP domain of tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 (TNKS1/2), regulators of the β-catenin destruction complex. Inhibition of TNKS1/2 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity by JW55 led to stabilization of AXIN2, a member of the β-catenin destruction complex, followed by increased degradation of β-catenin. In a dose-dependent manner, JW55 inhibited canonical Wnt signaling in colon carcinoma cells that contained mutations in either the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) locus or in an allele of β-catenin. In addition, JW55 reduced XWnt8-induced axis duplication in Xenopus embryos and tamoxifen-induced polyposis formation in conditional APC mutant mice. Together, our findings provide a novel chemotype for targeting canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling through inhibiting the PARP domain of TNKS1/2.	D	high	The study describes experiments conducted in colon carcinoma cell lines (in vitro) and in Xenopus embryos and conditional APC mutant mice (in vivo models). There is no mention of human patient data or clinical trials, which places it squarely in the 'Preclinical Evidence' category.
f1c08992-4102-559a-9508-01e920f86661	B	The impact on outcome of the addition of all-trans retinoic acid to intensive chemotherapy in younger patients with nonacute promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia: overall results and results in genotypic subgroups defined by mutations in NPM1, FLT3, and CEBPA.	We investigated the benefit of adding all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to chemotherapy for younger patients with nonacute promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, and considered interactions between treatment and molecular markers. Overall, 1075 patients less than 60 years of age were randomized to receive or not receive ATRA in addition to daunorubicin/Ara-C/thioguanine chemotherapy with Ara-C at standard or double standard dose. There were data on FLT3 internal tandem duplications and NPM1 mutations (n = 592), CEBPA mutations (n = 423), and MN1 expression (n = 195). The complete remission rate was 68% with complete remission with incomplete count recovery in an additional 16%; 8-year overall survival was 32%. There was no significant treatment effect for any outcome, with no significant interactions between treatment and demographics, or cytarabine randomization. Importantly, there were no interactions by FLT3/internal tandem duplications, NPM1, or CEBPA mutation. There was a suggestion that ATRA reduced relapse in patients with lower MN1 levels, but no significant effect on overall survival. Results were consistent when restricted to patients with normal karyotype. ATRA has no overall effect on treatment outcomes in this group of patients. The study did not identify any subgroup of patients likely to derive a significant survival benefit from the addition of ATRA to chemotherapy.	A	high	The abstract describes a large-scale randomized clinical trial involving 1075 patients. This type of study design, particularly with its size and randomization, is characteristic of a Phase III clinical trial, which falls under Level A evidence.
06269727-fa16-5dd7-8cd0-ece7bb71bad8	B	Evaluation of EGFR gene copy number as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: EXTREME study.	BACKGROUND: The phase III EXTREME study demonstrated that combining cetuximab with platinum/5-fluorouracil (5-FU) significantly improved overall survival in the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) compared with platinum/5-FU alone. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate elevated tumor EGFR gene copy number as a predictive biomarker in EXTREME study patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dual-color FISH was used to determine absolute and relative EGFR copy number. Models of differing stringencies were used to score and investigate whether increased copy number was predictive for the activity of cetuximab plus platinum/5-FU. RESULTS: Tumors from 312 of 442 patients (71%) were evaluable by FISH and met the criteria for statistical analysis. A moderate increase in EGFR copy number was common, with high-level amplification of the gene occurring in a small fraction of tumors (∼11%). Considering each of the models tested, no association of EGFR copy number with overall survival, progression-free survival or best overall response was found for patients treated with cetuximab plus platinum/5-FU. CONCLUSION: Tumor EGFR copy number is not a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of cetuximab plus platinum/5-FU as first-line therapy for patients with R/M SCCHN.	A	high	The study is a biomarker analysis conducted within the framework of a large, randomized Phase III clinical trial (EXTREME study). It evaluates a predictive biomarker (EGFR gene copy number) in a substantial cohort of human patients (312 evaluable). The findings, even though negative (no association found), are derived from a robust clinical trial design and provide a definitive conclusion regarding the biomarker's utility, which is highly impactful for clinical practice. This constitutes a 'validated association' (or lack thereof) in human medicine.
a4956065-bcaf-56d6-bf95-e33935a9574f	D	Amuvatinib has cytotoxic effects against NRAS-mutant melanoma but not BRAF-mutant melanoma.	Effective targeted therapy strategies are still lacking for the 15-20% of melanoma patients whose melanomas are driven by oncogenic NRAS. Here, we report on the NRAS-specific behavior of amuvatinib, a kinase inhibitor with activity against c-KIT, Axl, PDGFRα, and Rad51. An analysis of BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines showed the NRAS-mutant cohort to be enriched for targets of amuvatinib, including Axl, c-KIT, and the Axl ligand Gas6. Increasing concentrations of amuvatinib selectively inhibited the growth of NRAS-mutant, but not BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines, an effect associated with induction of S-phase and G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Mechanistically, amuvatinib was noted to either inhibit Axl, AKT, and MAPK signaling or Axl and AKT signaling and to induce a DNA damage response. In three-dimensional cell culture experiments, amuvatinib was cytotoxic against NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines. Thus, we show for the first time that amuvatinib has proapoptotic activity against melanoma cell lines, with selectivity observed for those harboring oncogenic NRAS.	D	high	The study exclusively uses in vitro models, specifically 'melanoma cell lines' and 'three-dimensional cell culture experiments,' without any direct human evidence or patient data.

8e01ff28-8350-5c0f-b1f6-5e15418e05c9	D	Molecular Changes Associated with Acquired Resistance to Crizotinib in ROS1-Rearranged Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	PURPOSE: Although ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is sensitive to crizotinib, development of resistance is inevitable. Here, we identified molecular alterations in crizotinib-resistant tumors from two NSCLC patients with the CD74-ROS1 rearrangement, and in HCC78 cells harboring SLC34A2-ROS1 that showed resistance to crizotinib (HCC78CR cells). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ROS1 kinase domain mutations were examined in fresh tumor tissues from two NSCLC patients and HCC78CR1-3 cells by direct sequencing. Ba/F3 cells expressing ROS1 secondary mutations were constructed to evaluate resistance to crizotinib. An upregulated pathway was identified using phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array, EGFR signaling antibody array, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Cell proliferation and ROS1 downstream signaling pathways were compared between HCC78 and HCC78CR1-3 cells. RESULTS: The ROS1 G2032R mutation was identified in crizotinib-resistant tumors from one patient. Furthermore, HCC78CR1 and CR2 cells harbored a novel ROS1 L2155S mutation (73.3% and 76.2%, respectively). ROS1 G2032R and L2155S mutations conferred resistance to crizotinib in Ba/F3 cells. Evidence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition with downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was observed in HCC78CR1-2 cells and in the other patient. RNA-seq and EGFR signaling antibody array revealed that the EGFR pathway was significantly upregulated in HCC78CR3 versus HCC78 cells. Cells with the ROS1 mutation and upregulated EGFR were sensitive to foretinib, an inhibitor of c-MET, VEGFR2, and ROS1 and irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors plus crizotinib, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular changes associated with acquired crizotinib resistance in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC are heterogeneous, including ROS1 tyrosine kinase mutations, EGFR activation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.	C	high	The study identifies molecular alterations in crizotinib-resistant tumors from two NSCLC patients, which constitutes a very small patient series (n=2). This falls under the definition of Level C (Case Study) as it involves fewer than 5 patients. While the study also includes extensive preclinical (in vitro) evidence, the direct human data, even if limited, elevates it beyond purely preclinical (Level D).
42acfd1d-de3a-5c3f-9594-9268697dcfb8	C	Long-term follow-up results of the multicenter phase II trial of regorafenib in patients with metastatic and/or unresectable GI stromal tumor after failure of standard tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.	BACKGROUND: This investigator-initiated trial provided the justification for the phase III GRID study resulting in worldwide regulatory approval of regorafenib as a third-line therapy for patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). We report the genotype analyses, long-term safety, and activity results from this initial trial of regorafenib in GIST. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The trial was conducted between February 2010 and January 2014, among adult patients with metastatic GIST, after failure of at least imatinib and sunitinib. Patients received regorafenib orally, 160 mg once daily, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle. Clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as complete or partial response (PR), or stable disease lasting ≥16 weeks per RECIST 1.1, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), long-term safety data, and metabolic response by functional imaging were assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients received at least one dose of regorafenib. The median follow-up was 41 months. CBR was documented in 25 of 33 patients [76%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 58% to 89%], including six PRs. The median PFS was 13.2 months (95% CI 9.2-18.3 months) including four patients who remained progression-free at study closure, each achieving clinical benefit for more than 3 years (range 36.8-43.5 months). The median OS was 25 months (95% CI 13.2-39.1 months). Patients whose tumors harbored a KIT exon 11 mutation demonstrated the longest median PFS (13.4 months), whereas patients with KIT/PDGFRA wild-type, non-SDH-deficient tumors experienced a median 1.6 months PFS (P < 0.0001). Long-term safety profile is consistent with previous reports; hand-foot skin reaction and hypertension were the most common reasons for dose reduction. Notably, regorafenib induced objective responses and durable benefit in SDH-deficient GIST. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up of patients with metastatic GIST treated with regorafenib suggests particular benefit among patients with primary KIT exon 11 mutations and those with SDH-deficient GIST. Dose modifications are frequently required to manage treatment-related toxicities. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT01068769.	B	high	This is a multicenter phase II clinical trial involving 33 patients, providing primary patient data and statistical results (e.g., CBR, PFS, OS, confidence intervals).

484baf50-dfd4-5997-b7d2-7d754f625792	D	Activating mutations in ALK provide a therapeutic target in neuroblastoma.	Neuroblastoma, an embryonal tumour of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, accounts for approximately 15% of all deaths due to childhood cancer. High-risk neuroblastomas are rapidly progressive; even with intensive myeloablative chemotherapy, relapse is common and almost uniformly fatal. Here we report the detection of previously unknown mutations in the ALK gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, in 8% of primary neuroblastomas. Five non-synonymous sequence variations were identified in the kinase domain of ALK, of which three were somatic and two were germ line. The most frequent mutation, F1174L, was also identified in three different neuroblastoma cell lines. ALK complementary DNAs encoding the F1174L and R1275Q variants, but not the wild-type ALK cDNA, transformed interleukin-3-dependent murine haematopoietic Ba/F3 cells to cytokine-independent growth. Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutations were sensitive to the small-molecule inhibitor of ALK, TAE684 (ref. 4). Furthermore, two human neuroblastoma cell lines harbouring the F1174L mutation were also sensitive to the inhibitor. Cytotoxicity was associated with increased amounts of apoptosis as measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of ALK expression in neuroblastoma cell lines with the F1174L mutation also resulted in apoptosis and impaired cell proliferation. Thus, activating alleles of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase are present in primary neuroblastoma tumours and in established neuroblastoma cell lines, and confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition with small molecules, providing a molecular rationale for targeted therapy of this disease.	D	high	The study identifies activating mutations in the ALK gene in primary human neuroblastoma samples (8% of cases), which is human observational data. However, the core finding that these mutations 'provide a therapeutic target' is primarily supported by extensive preclinical evidence, including functional validation in murine Ba/F3 cells and human neuroblastoma cell lines, demonstrating transformation and sensitivity to ALK inhibitors. While human samples were used for mutation detection, the therapeutic implication is derived from in vitro models, not direct clinical trials or patient outcomes related to the therapy.

PURPOSE: Clinical features of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, L858R, deletions in exon 19, T790M, and insertions in exon 20, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are well known. The clinical significance of other uncommon EGFR mutations, such as their association with the effectiveness of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), is not well understood. This study aimed to improve the understanding of these uncommon EGFR mutations of unknown clinical significance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Specimens from 1,261 patients were tested for EGFR mutations. We surveyed the clinical data and the effectiveness of gefitinib and erlotinib in NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. RESULTS: Of the 1,261 patients, 627 (49.8%) had EGFR mutations. This included 258 patients with deletions in exon 19, 260 patients with L858R, 25 patients with insertions or duplications in exon 20, 6 patients with de novo T790M, and 78 (12.4%) patients with uncommon mutations. Of the 78 patients, 62 received either gefitinib or erlotinib treatment. The response rate of TKIs treatment was 48.4%, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.0 months. Mutations on G719 and L861 composed a major part (28 of 62) of uncommon mutations, and were associated with a favorable effectiveness of EGFR TKIs (response rate, 57.1%; median PFS, 6.0 months). Mutations other than G719 and L861 led to a worse response to EGFR TKIs (response rate, 20.0%; median PFS, 1.6 months). CONCLUSIONS: Uncommon EGFR mutations constituted a distinct part of the whole group of EGFR mutations. Their composition was heterogeneous, and their associations with EGFR TKIs differed.	B	high	The study is a retrospective analysis of primary patient data from 1,261 patients, with 62 patients receiving TKI treatment for uncommon EGFR mutations. It presents clinical outcomes such as response rates and progression-free survival, which are statistical results from a cohort larger than 5 patients. This aligns with the definition of Level B, 'Clinical Evidence', as it involves direct human clinical data with statistical results, though it is not a prospective randomized Phase III trial.

In this case report, we describe a patient with <i>EML4-ALK</i>-rearranged stage IIIB MPM who was administered with alectinib and lorlatinib as first-line and fourth-line therapy, respectively. He had remarkable response evaluated as partial response on both regimens lasting approximately 3.5 months on each regimen. His plasma samples were collected during the treatment course and submitted for targeted sequencing to understand the molecular mechanisms of his therapeutic resistance. Sequencing analysis revealed the emergence of <i>ALK</i> I1171N and L1196M at alectinib progression. Meanwhile, <i>ALK</i> I1171N, L1196M, and G1202R mutations were identified at lorlatinib progression, wherein L1196M is confirmed to be in <i>cis</i> to G1202R. We speculate that these multiple mutations synergistically mediated his resistance to both alectinib and lorlatinib. Our report describes the detection of <i>EML4-ALK</i> rearrangement in a patient with MPM who had remarkable therapeutic response with ALK inhibitors. Moreover, our case also revealed acquired mechanisms of lorlatinib resistance mediated by multiple mutations <i>ALK</i> I1171N, L1196M, and G1202R, contributing an incremental step to our understanding of the complexity of acquired resistance mechanisms in sequential ALK inhibitor therapy. <i>The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.</i>	C	high	The title and abstract explicitly state that this is 'a case report' describing findings in 'a patient', which aligns with the definition of Level C evidence for case reports or very small patient series (<5 patients).
92f2fb79-2bae-5727-85e1-c68cde934705	D	Kinase mutations and imatinib response in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor.	PURPOSE: Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) express constitutively activated mutant isoforms of KIT or kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) that are potential therapeutic targets for imatinib mesylate. The relationship between mutations in these kinases and clinical response to imatinib was examined in a group of patients with advanced GIST. PATIENTS AND METHODS: GISTs from 127 patients enrolled onto a phase II clinical study of imatinib were examined for mutations of KIT or PDGFRA. Mutation types were correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: Activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA were found in 112 (88.2%) and six (4.7%) GISTs, respectively. Most KIT mutations involved exon 9 (n = 23) or exon 11 (n = 85). All KIT mutant isoforms, but only a subset of PDGFRA mutant isoforms, were sensitive to imatinib, in vitro. In patients with GISTs harboring exon 11 KIT mutations, the partial response rate (PR) was 83.5%, whereas patients with tumors containing an exon 9 KIT mutation or no detectable mutation of KIT or PDGFRA had PR rates of 47.8% (P =.0006) and 0.0% (P <.0001), respectively. Patients whose tumors contained exon 11 KIT mutations had a longer event-free and overall survival than those whose tumors expressed either exon 9 KIT mutations or had no detectable kinase mutation. CONCLUSION: Activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA are found in the vast majority of GISTs, and the mutational status of these oncoproteins is predictive of clinical response to imatinib. PDGFRA mutations can explain response and sensitivity to imatinib in some GISTs lacking KIT mutations.	B	high	This publication describes a Phase II clinical study involving 127 patients with advanced GIST. It directly correlates kinase mutations with clinical response rates, event-free survival, and overall survival to imatinib, providing primary patient data and statistical results.

fec95c0c-3abf-5ef9-8e67-57666c8db999	C	Dasatinib treatment of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia: analysis of responses according to preexisting BCR-ABL mutations.	Dasatinib is a BCR-ABL inhibitor with 325-fold higher potency than imatinib against unmutated BCR-ABL in vitro. Imatinib failure is commonly caused by BCR-ABL mutations. Here, dasatinib efficacy was analyzed in patients recruited to phase 2/3 trials with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia with or without BCR-ABL mutations after prior imatinib. Among 1043 patients, 39% had a preexisting BCR-ABL mutation, including 48% of 805 patients with imatinib resistance or suboptimal response. Sixty-threedifferent BCR-ABL mutations affecting 49 amino acids were detected at baseline, with G250, M351, M244, and F359 most frequently affected. After 2 years of follow-up, dasatinib treatment of imatinib-resistant patients with or without a mutation resulted in notable response rates (complete cytogenetic response: 43% vs 47%) and durable progression-free survival (70% vs 80%). High response rates were achieved with different mutations except T315I, including highly imatinib-resistant mutations in the P-loop region. Impaired responses were observed with some mutations with a dasatinib median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) greater than 3nM; among patients with mutations with lower or unknown IC(50), efficacy was comparable with those with no mutation. Overall, dasatinib has durable efficacy in patients with or without BCR-ABL mutations. All trials were registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00123474, NCT00101660, and NCT00103844.	A	high	The publication describes an analysis of data from phase 2/3 clinical trials involving 1043 patients.

ab2189ed-80cc-5e2d-8284-485c1a4b8aff	D	Neuregulin-1-mediated autocrine signaling underlies sensitivity to HER2 kinase inhibitors in a subset of human cancers.	HER2 kinase inhibitors, such as lapatinib, have demonstrated clinical efficacy in HER2-amplified breast cancers. By profiling nearly 700 human cancer cell lines, we identified a subset of non-HER2 amplified cancer cells with striking sensitivity to HER2 kinase inhibition-particularly from head and neck tumors. These cells were found to depend on a neuregulin-1 (NRG1)-mediated autocrine loop driving HER3 activation, which can be disrupted by lapatinib. Elevated NRG1 expression and activated HER3 are strongly associated with lapatinib sensitivity in vitro, and these biomarkers were enriched in a subset of primary head and neck cancer samples. The findings suggest that patients with NRG1-driven tumors lacking HER2 amplification may derive significant clinical benefit from HER2:HER3-directed therapies.	D	high	The study primarily relies on in vitro models, specifically profiling nearly 700 human cancer cell lines, to identify a mechanism of sensitivity to HER2 kinase inhibitors. While it mentions enrichment of biomarkers in 'primary head and neck cancer samples,' this is an observational finding supporting the preclinical work, not a clinical trial or direct evidence of treatment efficacy in patients. The core findings are derived from cell line experiments.
ed7ee7c7-7abf-57c5-b6a7-8d71fa7aa7b8	C	Examining Treatment Outcomes with Erlotinib in Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Whose Tumors Harbor Uncommon EGFR Mutations.	INTRODUCTION: Exon 19 deletions and the exon 21 L858R mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) predict activity of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including erlotinib; however, the ability of less common EGFR mutations to predict efficacy of erlotinib is unclear. METHODS: The efficacy of erlotinib in individual patients with rare EGFR mutations from the MERIT, SATURN, TITAN, TRUST, ATLAS, BeTa, and FASTACT-2 trials was analyzed and compared with data from the literature. RESULTS: In the patients tested for biomarkers, the frequency of rare mutations identified here ranged from 1.7% (eight of 467) in the SATURN study to 7.4% (27 of 364) in ATLAS. Some rare mutations were associated with greater clinical benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy or improved prognosis independent of treatment, whereas others appeared to have a poorer prognosis. In particular, exon 18 G719 mutations, exon 19 K757R and E746G mutations, the exon 20 S768I mutation, and the exon 21 G836S mutation appeared to confer a good outcome with erlotinib treatment, whereas exon 18 S720I showed a particularly poor outcome. Owing to the small number of patients with each mutation, however, it is difficult to confirm whether these rare mutations do indeed confer sensitivity or resistance to erlotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Erlotinib can have different efficacy depending on the specific EGFR mutation. More research is needed to create a central database such as the My Cancer Genome database of rare mutations to definitively confirm whether these mutations are activating, resistant, or neutral.	B	high	The study re-analyzes efficacy data from individual patients with rare EGFR mutations from multiple large clinical trials (MERIT, SATURN, TITAN, TRUST, ATLAS, BeTa, and FASTACT-2). This constitutes clinical evidence derived from human patient data in clinical trials, with patient numbers well exceeding 5, making it consistent with Level B. While the authors note limitations due to small numbers for *each specific* rare mutation, the overall study design is based on clinical trial data.

However, the potential role of other genes downstream of the EGFR signaling pathway in conferring acquired resistance has not been extensively investigated.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients with mCRC and with acquired cetuximab resistance, we developed a targeted amplicon ultra-deep sequencing method to screen for low-abundance somatic mutations in a panel of genes that encode components of the EGFR signaling pathway. Mutations with significantly increased variant frequencies upon disease progression were selected by using quartile analysis. The functional consequences of the identified mutations were validated in cultured cells.<b>Results:</b> We analyzed 32 patients with acquired cetuximab resistance in a development cohort. Of them, seven (22%) carried five novel <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations, whereas eight (25%) carried previously reported <i>KRAS</i> mutations. Functional studies showed that novel <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations (all in exon 19; p.K944N, p.F930S, p.V955G, p.V955I, and p.K966E) promote cell viability in the presence of cetuximab. Only one novel <i>PIK3CA</i> mutation (p.K944N) was verified in one of the 27 patients with acquired resistance in a validation cohort, simultaneous <i>KRAS</i> and <i>PIK3CA</i> hotspot mutations were detected in two patients. Among the above 59 acquired resistance patients, those with <i>PIK3CA</i> or <i>RAS</i> mutations detected in ctDNA showed a pronounced decrease in progression-free survival than patients with no mutation.<b>Conclusions:</b> The <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations may potentially contribute to acquired cetuximab resistance in patients with mCRC. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(16); 4602-16. ©2017 AACR</i>.

b84d91d0-494a-585f-8b42-52d04e93372d	D	Blocking NRG1 and other ligand-mediated Her4 signaling enhances the magnitude and duration of the chemotherapeutic response of non-small cell lung cancer.	Although standard chemotherapies are commonly used to treat most types of solid tumors, such treatment often results in inadequate response to, or relapse after, therapy. This is particularly relevant for lung cancer because most patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease and are treated with frontline chemotherapy. By studying the residual tumor cells that remain after chemotherapy in several in vivo non-small cell lung cancer models, we found that these cells have increased levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) signaling due, in part, to the enrichment of a preexisting NRG1(HI) subpopulation. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) signaling in these models can be mediated by either the HER3 or HER4 receptor, resulting in the differential activation of downstream effectors. Inhibition of NRG1 signaling inhibits primary tumor growth and enhances the magnitude and duration of the response to chemotherapy. Moreover, we show that inhibition of ligand-mediated Her4 signaling impedes disease relapse in cases where NRG1 inhibition is insufficient. These findings demonstrate that ligand-dependent Her4 signaling plays an important role in disease relapse.

PURPOSE: The identification of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who are expected to benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy is of interest. We conducted a single-arm phase II clinical trial of single-agent platinum for mTNBC with biomarker correlates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with mTNBC received first- or second-line cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) or carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve 6) by physician's choice once every 3 weeks. Coprimary end points were objective response rate (RR) and response prediction by p63/p73 gene expression. Secondary and exploratory end points included toxicity assessment, RR in cisplatin versus carboplatin, and RR in molecularly defined subgroups, including BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. RESULTS: Patients (N = 86; 69 as first-line therapy) received cisplatin (n = 43) or carboplatin (n = 43). RR was 25.6% (95% CI, 16.8% to 36%) and was numerically higher with cisplatin (32.6%) than with carboplatin (18.7%). RR was 54.5% in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 11). In patients without BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 66), exploratory analyses showed that a BRCA-like genomic instability signature (n = 32) discriminated responding and nonresponding tumors (mean homologous recombination deficiency-loss of heterozygosity/homologous recombination deficiency-large-scale state transitions [HRD-LOH/HRD-LST] scores were 12.68 and 5.11, respectively), whereas predefined analysis by p63/p73 expression status (n = 61), p53 and PIK3CA mutation status (n = 53), or PAM50 gene expression subtype (n = 55) did not. Five of the six long-term responders alive at a median of 4.5 years lacked germline BRCA1/2 mutations, and two of them had increased tumor HRD-LOH/HRD-LST scores. CONCLUSION: Platinum agents are active in mTNBC, especially in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. A measure of tumor DNA repair function may identify patients without mutations who could benefit from platinum therapy agents. Prospective controlled confirmatory trials are warranted.

20744627-d206-5ab8-a417-c763750dfbef	D	Axitinib effectively inhibits BCR-ABL1(T315I) with a distinct binding conformation.	The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is a driver oncogene in chronic myeloid leukaemia and 30-50% of cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Introduction of ABL1 kinase inhibitors (for example, imatinib) has markedly improved patient survival, but acquired drug resistance remains a challenge. Point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain weaken inhibitor binding and represent the most common clinical resistance mechanism. The BCR-ABL1 kinase domain gatekeeper mutation Thr315Ile (T315I) confers resistance to all approved ABL1 inhibitors except ponatinib, which has toxicity limitations. Here we combine comprehensive drug sensitivity and resistance profiling of patient cells ex vivo with structural analysis to establish the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a selective and effective inhibitor for T315I-mutant BCR-ABL1-driven leukaemia. Axitinib potently inhibited BCR-ABL1(T315I), at both biochemical and cellular levels, by binding to the active form of ABL1(T315I) in a mutation-selective binding mode. These findings suggest that the T315I mutation shifts the conformational equilibrium of the kinase in favour of an active (DFG-in) A-loop conformation, which has more optimal binding interactions with axitinib. Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unexpected opportunity to repurpose axitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug approved for renal cancer, as an inhibitor for ABL1 gatekeeper mutant drug-resistant leukaemia patients. This study shows that wild-type proteins do not always sample the conformations available to disease-relevant mutant proteins and that comprehensive drug testing of patient-derived cells can identify unpredictable, clinically significant drug-repositioning opportunities.	C	high	The abstract describes preclinical evidence using patient cells ex vivo and biochemical/cellular assays, which would typically be Level D. However, it also includes a report of 'Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow.' This constitutes a single patient case report, which falls under Level C.
ae4a1771-5eb7-5729-8be4-bd5f9aecdf9d	C	ERBB2 Mutations Characterize a Subgroup of Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancers with Excellent Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.	UNLABELLED: A pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) containing platinum is a strong prognostic determinant for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Despite comprehensive molecular characterization of bladder cancer, associations of molecular alterations with treatment response are still largely unknown. We selected pathologic complete responders (ypT0N0; n=38) and nonresponders (higher than ypT2; n=33) from a cohort of high-grade MIBC patients treated with NAC. DNA was isolated from prechemotherapy tumor tissue and used for next-generation sequencing of 178 cancer-associated genes (discovery cohort) or targeted sequencing (validation cohort). We found that 9 of 38 complete responders had erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2) missense mutations, whereas none of 33 nonresponders had ERBB2 mutations (p=0.003). ERBB2 missense mutations in complete responders were mostly confirmed activating mutations. ERCC2 missense mutations, recently found associated with response to NAC, were more common in complete responders; however, this association did not reach statistical significance in our cohort. We conclude that ERBB2 missense mutations characterize a subgroup of MIBC patients with an excellent response to NAC. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report we looked for genetic alterations that can predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in bladder cancer. We found that mutations in the gene ERBB2 are exclusively present in patients responding to NAC.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from a cohort of 71 human patients (38 responders and 33 non-responders) and presents statistically significant findings (p=0.003) regarding the association between ERBB2 mutations and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This aligns with Level B, which includes clinical trials (though this is a retrospective cohort analysis, it uses primary patient data) or primary patient data with more than 5 patients and statistical results, but is less definitive than Level A.
a9634f48-b32b-5a49-a082-2c65de67e0c5	D	Inhibition of glutaminase selectively suppresses the growth of primary acute myeloid leukemia cells with IDH mutations.	The incidence of mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is approximately 20%. These mutations result in distinct metabolic characteristics including dependency of cancer cells on glutamine as the main source for α-ketoglutarate, which is consumed by leukemia cells to produce a cancer-derived metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate. We sought to exploit this glutamine addiction therapeutically in mutant IDH primary AML cells from patients by measuring cell growth after exposure to a small molecule glutaminase inhibitor, BPTES. We found that BPTES only suppressed the growth of AML cells expressing mutant IDH compared with those expressing wild type IDH. This study lays the groundwork for strategies to target a specific subtype of AML metabolically with IDH mutations with a unique reprogramming of intermediary metabolism that culminates in glutamine dependency of cancer cells for survival.	D	high	The study describes experiments conducted on 'primary AML cells from patients' in an in vitro setting, measuring cell growth after exposure to an inhibitor. This constitutes an in vitro model, which falls under preclinical evidence, as it is not direct human evidence from clinical trials or patient observations.
4d7d3a3b-df5d-5dbf-82f7-a8ef29bbb42e	D	Inhibition of MEK and PI3K/mTOR suppresses tumor growth but does not cause tumor regression in patient-derived xenografts of RAS-mutant colorectal carcinomas.	PURPOSE: Gene mutations along the Ras pathway (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA) occur in approximately 50% of colorectal cancers (CRC) and correlate with poor response to anti-EGF receptor (EGFR) therapies. We assessed the effects of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR inhibitors, which neutralize the major Ras effectors, in patient-derived xenografts from RAS/RAF/PIK3CA-mutant metastatic CRCs (mCRC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty mCRC specimens harboring KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and/or PIK3CA mutations were implanted in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Each xenograft was expanded into four treatment arms: placebo, the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235, or AZD6244 + BEZ235. Cases initially treated with placebo crossed over to AZD6244, BEZ235, and the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. RESULTS: At the 3-week evaluation time point, cotreatment of established tumors with AZD6244 + BEZ235 induced disease stabilization in the majority of cases (70%) but did not lead to overt tumor regression. Monotherapy was less effective, with BEZ235 displaying higher activity than AZD6244 (disease control rates, DCRs: AZD6244, 27.5%; BEZ235, 42.5%). Triple therapy with cetuximab provided further advantage (DCR, 88%). The extent of disease control declined at the 6-week evaluation time point (DCRs: AZD6244, 13.9%; BEZ235, 16.2%; AZD6244 + BEZ235, 34%). Cross-analysis of mice harboring xenografts from the same original tumor and treated with each of the different modalities revealed subgroups with preferential sensitivity to AZD6244 (12.5%), BEZ235 (35%), or AZD6244 + BEZ235 (42.5%); another subgroup (10%) showed equivalent response to any treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalent growth-suppressive effects produced by MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition suggest that this strategy may retard disease progression in patients. However, data offer cautionary evidence against the occurrence of durable responses.	D	high	The study utilizes patient-derived xenografts implanted in mice (NOD/SCID mice), which is a preclinical in vivo model. This falls under Level D as it is not direct human evidence.
d48023f5-2a4e-5ee5-952c-ff749f4718cb	D	ATM mutations uniformly lead to ATM dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: application of functional test using doxorubicin.	ATM abnormalities are frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and represent an important prognostic factor. Sole 11q deletion does not result in ATM inactivation by contrast to biallelic defects involving mutations. Therefore, the analysis of ATM mutations and their functional impact is crucial. In this study, we analyzed ATM mutations in predominantly high-risk patients using: i) resequencing microarray and direct sequencing; ii) Western blot for total ATM level; iii) functional test based on p21 gene induction after parallel treatment of leukemic cells with fludarabine and doxorubicin. ATM dysfunction leads to impaired p21 induction after doxorubicin exposure. We detected ATM mutation in 16% (22 of 140) of patients, and all mutated samples manifested demonstrable ATM defect (impaired p21 upregulation after doxorubicin and/or null protein level). Loss of ATM function in mutated samples was also evidenced through defective p53 pathway activation after ionizing radiation exposure. ATM mutation frequency was 34% in patients with 11q deletion, 4% in the TP53-defected group, and 8% in wild-type patients. Our functional test, convenient for routine use, showed high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (97%) for ATM mutations prediction. Only cells with ATM mutation, but not those with sole 11q deletion, were resistant to doxorubicin. As far as fludarabine is concerned, this difference was not observed. Interestingly, patients from both these groups experienced nearly identical time to first treatment. In conclusion, ATM mutations either alone or in combination with 11q deletion uniformly led to demonstrable ATM dysfunction in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mutation presence can be predicted by the functional test using doxorubicin.	B	high	The study analyzes ATM mutations and their functional impact in 140 human patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It uses primary patient data, includes statistical results (e.g., mutation frequency, sensitivity and specificity of a functional test), and investigates a clinical association and a diagnostic method. This aligns with the definition of Level B, which includes clinical trials or primary patient data with more than 5 patients and statistical results, but is less definitive than Level A.

In this case report, we describe a patient with <i>EML4-ALK</i>-rearranged stage IIIB MPM who was administered with alectinib and lorlatinib as first-line and fourth-line therapy, respectively. He had remarkable response evaluated as partial response on both regimens lasting approximately 3.5 months on each regimen. His plasma samples were collected during the treatment course and submitted for targeted sequencing to understand the molecular mechanisms of his therapeutic resistance. Sequencing analysis revealed the emergence of <i>ALK</i> I1171N and L1196M at alectinib progression. Meanwhile, <i>ALK</i> I1171N, L1196M, and G1202R mutations were identified at lorlatinib progression, wherein L1196M is confirmed to be in <i>cis</i> to G1202R. We speculate that these multiple mutations synergistically mediated his resistance to both alectinib and lorlatinib. Our report describes the detection of <i>EML4-ALK</i> rearrangement in a patient with MPM who had remarkable therapeutic response with ALK inhibitors. Moreover, our case also revealed acquired mechanisms of lorlatinib resistance mediated by multiple mutations <i>ALK</i> I1171N, L1196M, and G1202R, contributing an incremental step to our understanding of the complexity of acquired resistance mechanisms in sequential ALK inhibitor therapy. <i>The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.</i>	C	high	The publication is explicitly identified as a 'case report' in both the title and abstract, detailing the clinical course and molecular findings for a single patient.
e74e5fb7-5eba-5f09-bbb8-d79e1e41fa31	D	p53-mediated senescence impairs the apoptotic response to chemotherapy and clinical outcome in breast cancer.	Studies on the role of TP53 mutation in breast cancer response to chemotherapy are conflicting. Here, we show that, contrary to dogma, MMTV-Wnt1 mammary tumors with mutant p53 exhibited a superior clinical response compared to tumors with wild-type p53. Doxorubicin-treated p53 mutant tumors failed to arrest proliferation, leading to abnormal mitoses and cell death, whereas p53 wild-type tumors arrested, avoiding mitotic catastrophe. Senescent tumor cells persisted, secreting senescence-associated cytokines exhibiting autocrine/paracrine activity and mitogenic potential. Wild-type p53 still mediated arrest and inhibited drug response even in the context of heterozygous p53 point mutations or absence of p21. Thus, we show that wild-type p53 activity hinders chemotherapy response and demonstrate the need to reassess the paradigm for p53 in cancer therapy.	D	high	The abstract explicitly states the use of 'MMTV-Wnt1 mammary tumors,' which are a well-known mouse model for breast cancer. This indicates a preclinical study conducted in an in vivo animal model, not direct human evidence.
60650d31-3885-5127-b6b9-b35a7ac27125	C	Structural, biochemical, and clinical characterization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations in lung cancer.	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations (G719X, exon 19 deletions/insertions, L858R, and L861Q) predict favorable responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations (~10% of all EGFR mutations) are generally associated with insensitivity to available TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib). The basis of this primary resistance is poorly understood. We studied a broad subset of exon 20 insertion mutations, comparing in vitro TKI sensitivity with responses to gefitinib and erlotinib in NSCLC patients, and found that most are resistant to EGFR TKIs. The crystal structure of a representative TKI-insensitive mutant (D770_N771insNPG) reveals an unaltered adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket, and the inserted residues form a wedge at the end of the C helix that promotes the active kinase conformation. Unlike EGFR-L858R, D770_N771insNPG activates EGFR without increasing its affinity for EGFR TKIs. Unexpectedly, we find that EGFR-A763_Y764insFQEA is highly sensitive to EGFR TKIs in vitro, and patients whose NSCLCs harbor this mutation respond to erlotinib. Analysis of the A763_Y764insFQEA mutant indicates that the inserted residues shift the register of the C helix in the N-terminal direction, altering the structure in the region that is also affected by the TKI-sensitive EGFR-L858R. Our studies reveal intricate differences between EGFR mutations, their biology, and their response to EGFR TKIs.	B	high	The study includes primary patient data, observing responses to EGFR TKIs in NSCLC patients with specific exon 20 insertion mutations. While it also contains extensive preclinical (in vitro, structural, biochemical) evidence, the inclusion of patient response data elevates it beyond purely preclinical or case study level. The abstract refers to 'NSCLC patients' and 'patients whose NSCLCs harbor this mutation respond', implying more than a single case report or a very small series (<5 patients), aligning with Level B criteria for clinical evidence.
33a2c541-e344-5dfe-b9e2-7eead9f9159f	D	Activation of MET via diverse exon 14 splicing alterations occurs in multiple tumor types and confers clinical sensitivity to MET inhibitors.	UNLABELLED: Focal amplification and activating point mutation of the MET gene are well-characterized oncogenic drivers that confer susceptibility to targeted MET inhibitors. Recurrent somatic splice site alterations at MET exon 14 (METex14) that result in exon skipping and MET activation have been characterized, but their full diversity and prevalence across tumor types are unknown. Here, we report analysis of tumor genomic profiles from 38,028 patients to identify 221 cases with METex14 mutations (0.6%), including 126 distinct sequence variants. METex14 mutations are detected most frequently in lung adenocarcinoma (3%), but also frequently in other lung neoplasms (2.3%), brain glioma (0.4%), and tumors of unknown primary origin (0.4%). Further in vitro studies demonstrate sensitivity to MET inhibitors in cells harboring METex14 alterations. We also report three new patient cases with METex14 alterations in lung or histiocytic sarcoma tumors that showed durable response to two different MET-targeted therapies. The diversity of METex14 mutations indicates that diagnostic testing via comprehensive genomic profiling is necessary for detection in a clinical setting. SIGNIFICANCE: Here we report the identification of diverse exon 14 splice site alterations in MET that result in constitutive activity of this receptor and oncogenic transformation in vitro. Patients whose tumors harbored these alterations derived meaningful clinical benefit from MET inhibitors. Collectively, these data support the role of METex14 alterations as drivers of tumorigenesis, and identify a unique subset of patients likely to derive benefit from MET inhibitors.	B	high	The study involves the analysis of tumor genomic profiles from 38,028 patients, identifying 221 cases with METex14 mutations. This constitutes primary patient data with a large number of patients, providing statistical results on prevalence and diversity. Additionally, it reports three new patient cases that showed durable response to MET-targeted therapies, which is direct clinical evidence of benefit. While it includes in vitro studies, the primary strength of evidence comes from the large-scale patient data analysis and the reported clinical responses, aligning with Level B criteria for clinical evidence from primary patient data with more than 5 patients.
010571fe-46b5-58f6-8e0a-332b5daf17d0	D	In vitro activity of Bcr-Abl inhibitors AMN107 and BMS-354825 against clinically relevant imatinib-resistant Abl kinase domain mutants.	Imatinib, a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a highly effective therapy for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Despite durable responses in most chronic phase patients, relapses have been observed and are much more prevalent in patients with advanced disease. The most common mechanism of acquired imatinib resistance has been traced to Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations with decreased imatinib sensitivity. Thus, alternate Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors that have activity against imatinib-resistant mutants would be useful for patients who relapse on imatinib therapy. Two such Bcr-Abl inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials: the improved potency, selective Abl inhibitor AMN107 and the highly potent dual Src/Abl inhibitor BMS-354825. In the current article, we compared imatinib, AMN107, and BMS-354825 in cellular and biochemical assays against a panel of 16 kinase domain mutants representing >90% of clinical isolates. We report that AMN107 and BMS-354825 are 20-fold and 325-fold more potent than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type Bcr-Abl and that similar improvements are maintained for all imatinib-resistant mutants tested, with the exception of T315I. Thus, both inhibitors hold promise for treating imatinib-refractory CML.	D	high	The study explicitly states it investigates 'in vitro activity' and uses 'cellular and biochemical assays' to compare inhibitors against kinase domain mutants. This aligns with the definition of preclinical evidence, which involves in vitro models and not direct human evidence.

PURPOSE: Clinical features of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, L858R, deletions in exon 19, T790M, and insertions in exon 20, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are well known. The clinical significance of other uncommon EGFR mutations, such as their association with the effectiveness of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), is not well understood. This study aimed to improve the understanding of these uncommon EGFR mutations of unknown clinical significance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Specimens from 1,261 patients were tested for EGFR mutations. We surveyed the clinical data and the effectiveness of gefitinib and erlotinib in NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. RESULTS: Of the 1,261 patients, 627 (49.8%) had EGFR mutations. This included 258 patients with deletions in exon 19, 260 patients with L858R, 25 patients with insertions or duplications in exon 20, 6 patients with de novo T790M, and 78 (12.4%) patients with uncommon mutations. Of the 78 patients, 62 received either gefitinib or erlotinib treatment. The response rate of TKIs treatment was 48.4%, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.0 months. Mutations on G719 and L861 composed a major part (28 of 62) of uncommon mutations, and were associated with a favorable effectiveness of EGFR TKIs (response rate, 57.1%; median PFS, 6.0 months). Mutations other than G719 and L861 led to a worse response to EGFR TKIs (response rate, 20.0%; median PFS, 1.6 months). CONCLUSIONS: Uncommon EGFR mutations constituted a distinct part of the whole group of EGFR mutations. Their composition was heterogeneous, and their associations with EGFR TKIs differed.	B	high	The study is a retrospective analysis of clinical data from a large cohort of patients (1,261 screened, with 62 patients receiving TKI treatment for uncommon EGFR mutations).

IMPORTANCE: There are no specifically approved targeted therapies for the most common genomically defined subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), KRAS-mutant lung cancer. OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor selumetinib + docetaxel with docetaxel alone as a second-line therapy for advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multinational, randomized clinical trial conducted at 202 sites across 25 countries from October 2013 through January 2016. Of 3323 patients with advanced NSCLC and disease progression following first-line anticancer therapy tested for a KRAS mutation, 866 were enrolled and 510 randomized. Primary reason for exclusion was ineligibility. The data cutoff date for analysis was June 7, 2016. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1; 254 to receive selumetinib + docetaxel and 256 to receive placebo + docetaxel. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was investigator assessed progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, objective response rate, duration of response, effects on disease-related symptoms, safety, and tolerability. RESULTS: Of 510 randomized patients (mean age, 61.4 years [SD, 8.3]; women, 207 [41%]), 505 patients (99%) received treatment and completed the study (251 received selumetinib + docetaxel; 254 received placebo + docetaxel). At the time of data cutoff, 447 patients (88%) had experienced a progression event and 346 deaths (68%) had occurred. Median progression-free survival was 3.9 months (interquartile range [IQR], 1.5-5.9) with selumetinib + docetaxel and 2.8 months (IQR, 1.4-5.5) with placebo + docetaxel (difference, 1.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.77-1.12]; P = .44). Median overall survival was 8.7 months (IQR, 3.6-16.8) with selumetinib + docetaxel and 7.9 months (IQR, 3.8-20.1) with placebo + docetaxel (difference, 0.9 months; HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.85-1.30]; P = .64). Objective response rate was 20.1% with selumetinib + docetaxel and 13.7% with placebo + docetaxel (difference, 6.4%; odds ratio, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.00-2.62]; P = .05). Median duration of response was 2.9 months (IQR, 1.7-4.8; 95% CI, 2.7-4.1) with selumetinib + docetaxel and 4.5 months (IQR, 2.3-7.3; 95% CI, 2.8-5.6) with placebo + docetaxel. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were more frequent with selumetinib + docetaxel (169 adverse events [67%] for selumetinib + docetaxel vs 115 adverse events [45%] for placebo + docetaxel; difference, 22%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with previously treated advanced KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, addition of selumetinib to docetaxel did not improve progression-free survival compared with docetaxel alone.

Infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma, which classically presents as an aggressive and rapidly enlarging tumor over the distal extremities of children in their first year of life. The presence of <i>ETV6</i> and <i>NTRK3</i> gene rearrangement is characteristic of IFS, which can be detected on routine fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing. Patients with IFS typically respond well to surgical resection and chemotherapy and have an overall survival of ∼90%. In this report, we outline the use of integrative clinical sequencing (ICS) including RNA-seq in a patient with refractory, metastatic IFS to reveal an unusual fusion (<i>LMNA-NTRK1</i>), not detected by routine FISH testing, which was treated with oral crizotinib and resulted in a complete and durable long-term response. This study highlights the utility of ICS in identifying cryptic gene fusions, especially in refractory malignancies, and demonstrates how such information can be used to select targeted therapies in patients with actionable molecular alterations.	C	high	The abstract explicitly states, 'In this report, we outline the use of integrative clinical sequencing (ICS) including RNA-seq in a patient with refractory, metastatic IFS...' This indicates a single-patient case report, which falls under Level C.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ALK + DLBCL) is a rare and poorly characterized subtype of lymphoma. Reports suggest that this type of tumor responds poorly to standard regimens for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with rituximab playing no therapeutic role due to the absence of CD20 expression. In view of the expression of ALK in this disease, it is plausible that the ALK inhibitor crizotinib may be an effective treatment. We report a case of a 21-year-old male ALK + DLBCL patient. He initially received five cycles of CHOP-21 (vincristine, pirarubicin, cyclophosphamide and prednisone) and achieved a partial remission (PR) but soon deteriorated. He was subsequently treated with five courses of the salvage chemotherapy regimen ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide) and achieved PR again. He refused to accept an autologous stem-cell transplantation, after which the disease progressed rapidly. We administered two courses of an alternative salvage chemotherapy regimen containing GEMOX and dexamethasone with the addition of the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. His symptoms alleviated for a short time but soon worsened and the patient died of massive progressive disease.	C	high	The publication explicitly states 'We report a case of a 21-year-old male ALK + DLBCL patient,' indicating it is a single-patient case report.

PURPOSE: Addition of bevacizumab to trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) was associated with favorable outcome in the BEVERLY-2 phase II trial. Circulating levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2 and 9 were correlated to high response rate and prolonged survival in high-grade glioma treated with bevacizumab. We examined the prognostic impact of MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels in BEVERLY-2 patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels were assessed using ELISA at baseline and before surgery in 45/52 available samples. Correlations were tested with pathological complete response (pCR), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Baseline (b) MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels were independent from patient characteristics and circulating tumor or endothelial cells, and were not correlated to pCR. High bMMP2 was correlated to better DFS (p=0.001) and OS (p=0.032), while low bMMP9 was correlated to better OS (p=0.022) and tended to be associated with longer DFS (p=0.071). In multivariate analyses, bMMP2 (p=0.003, Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.115) and bMMP9 (p=0.041, HR: 3.511) remained correlated to DFS. As continuous variables, bMMP2 was associated with relapse (p=0.002) and death (p=0.049), while bMMP9 was associated with death (p=0.035). During treatment, significant increase in MMP2 and decrease in MMP9 levels (p<0.001 for both) were observed in 100% and 87% of patients respectively. CONCLUSIONS: High bMMP2 and low bMMP9 serum levels were associated with better survival in HER2-positive IBC patients treated with bevacizumab- and trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Their predictive value of bevacizumab benefit should be evaluated in a randomized trial.	B	high	The study is based on data from the BEVERLY-2 phase II clinical trial, involving 45 patients.

Bosutinib, a dual Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has shown potent activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This phase 1/2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily bosutinib 500 mg in leukemia patients after resistance/intolerance to imatinib. The current analysis included 118 patients with chronic-phase CML who had been pretreated with imatinib followed by dasatinib and/or nilotinib, with a median follow-up of 28.5 months. In this subpopulation, major cytogenetic response was attained by 32% of patients; complete cytogenetic response was attained by 24%, including in one of 3 patients treated with 3 prior TKIs. Complete hematologic response was achieved/maintained in 73% of patients. On-treatment transformation to accelerated/blast phase occurred in 5 patients. At 2 years, Kaplan-Meier-estimated progression-free survival was 73% and estimated overall survival was 83%. Responses were seen across Bcr-Abl mutations, including those associated with dasatinib and nilotinib resistance, except T315I. Bosutinib had an acceptable safety profile; treatment-emergent adverse events were primarily manageable grade 1/2 gastrointestinal events and rash. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic adverse events (> 2% of patients) included diarrhea (8%) and rash (4%). Bosutinib may offer a new treatment option for patients with chronic-phase CML after treatment with multiple TKIs. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00261846.

d48023f5-2a4e-5ee5-952c-ff749f4718cb	D	ATM mutations uniformly lead to ATM dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: application of functional test using doxorubicin.	ATM abnormalities are frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and represent an important prognostic factor. Sole 11q deletion does not result in ATM inactivation by contrast to biallelic defects involving mutations. Therefore, the analysis of ATM mutations and their functional impact is crucial. In this study, we analyzed ATM mutations in predominantly high-risk patients using: i) resequencing microarray and direct sequencing; ii) Western blot for total ATM level; iii) functional test based on p21 gene induction after parallel treatment of leukemic cells with fludarabine and doxorubicin. ATM dysfunction leads to impaired p21 induction after doxorubicin exposure. We detected ATM mutation in 16% (22 of 140) of patients, and all mutated samples manifested demonstrable ATM defect (impaired p21 upregulation after doxorubicin and/or null protein level). Loss of ATM function in mutated samples was also evidenced through defective p53 pathway activation after ionizing radiation exposure. ATM mutation frequency was 34% in patients with 11q deletion, 4% in the TP53-defected group, and 8% in wild-type patients. Our functional test, convenient for routine use, showed high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (97%) for ATM mutations prediction. Only cells with ATM mutation, but not those with sole 11q deletion, were resistant to doxorubicin. As far as fludarabine is concerned, this difference was not observed. Interestingly, patients from both these groups experienced nearly identical time to first treatment. In conclusion, ATM mutations either alone or in combination with 11q deletion uniformly led to demonstrable ATM dysfunction in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mutation presence can be predicted by the functional test using doxorubicin.	B	high	The study analyzes ATM mutations and their functional impact in 140 human patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

f34c0833-d4c9-5635-b05f-bdb31ce9d070	B	KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and PTEN mutations: implications for targeted therapies in metastatic colorectal cancer.	The discovery of mutant KRAS as a predictor of resistance to epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies brought a major change in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. This seminal finding also highlighted our sparse knowledge about key signalling pathways in colorectal tumours. Drugs that inhibit oncogenic alterations such as phospho-MAP2K (also called MEK), phospho-AKT, and mutant B-RAF seem promising as single treatment or when given with EGFR inhibitors. However, our understanding of the precise role these potential drug targets have in colorectal tumours, and the oncogenic dependence that tumours might have on these components, has not progressed at the same rate. As a result, patient selection and prediction of treatment effects remain problematic. We review the role of mutations in genes other than KRAS on the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy, and discuss strategies to target these oncogenic alterations alone or in combination with receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibition.	E	high	The abstract explicitly states, 'We review the role of mutations... and discuss strategies to target these oncogenic alterations...'

As such, it falls under 'Inferential Association' because it provides indirect or inferred evidence, discussing hypothesized mechanisms and strategies without presenting new direct measurements.
3f49b91f-edc0-58d9-9063-f27483f7da63	C	Dasatinib in imatinib-resistant Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias.	BACKGROUND: The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is effective in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) leukemias, but relapse occurs, mainly as a result of the outgrowth of leukemic subclones with imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations. We evaluated dasatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor that targets most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Patients with various phases of CML or with Ph-positive ALL who could not tolerate or were resistant to imatinib were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation study. Dasatinib (15 to 240 mg per day) was administered orally in four-week treatment cycles, once or twice daily. RESULTS: A complete hematologic response was achieved in 37 of 40 patients with chronic-phase CML, and major hematologic responses were seen in 31 of 44 patients with accelerated-phase CML, CML with blast crisis, or Ph-positive ALL. In these two phases, the rates of major cytogenetic response were 45 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Responses were maintained in 95 percent of patients with chronic-phase disease and in 82 percent of patients with accelerated-phase disease, with a median follow-up more than 12 months and 5 months, respectively. Nearly all patients with lymphoid blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL had a relapse within six months. Responses occurred among all BCR-ABL genotypes, with the exception of the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to both dasatinib and imatinib in vitro. Myelosuppression was common but not dose-limiting. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib induces hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with CML or Ph-positive ALL who cannot tolerate or are resistant to imatinib.

PURPOSE: Two phase II studies assessed the efficacy of vismodegib, a sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway inhibitor that binds smoothened (SMO), in pediatric and adult recurrent medulloblastoma (MB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients enrolled onto PBTC-025B and pediatric patients enrolled onto PBTC-032 were treated with vismodegib (150 to 300 mg/d). Protocol-defined response, which had to be sustained for 8 weeks, was confirmed by central neuroimaging review. Molecular tests to identify patterns of response and insensitivity were performed when tissue was available. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients were enrolled onto PBTC-025B, and 12 were enrolled onto PBTC-032. Three patients in PBTC-025B and one in PBTC-032, all with SHH-subgroup MB (SHH-MB), exhibited protocol-defined responses. Progression-free survival (PFS) was longer in those with SHH-MB than in those with non-SHH-MB, and prolonged disease stabilization occurred in 41% of patient cases of SHH-MB. Among those with SHH-MB, loss of heterozygosity of PTCH1 was associated with prolonged PFS, and diffuse staining of P53 was associated with reduced PFS. Whole-exome sequencing identified mutations in SHH genes downstream from SMO in four of four tissue samples from nonresponders and upstream of SMO in two of four patients with favorable responses. CONCLUSION: Vismodegib exhibits activity against adult recurrent SHH-MB but not against recurrent non-SHH-MB. Inadequate accrual of pediatric patients precluded conclusions in this population. Molecular analyses support the hypothesis that SMO inhibitor activity depends on the genomic aberrations within the tumor. Such inhibitors should be advanced in SHH-MB studies; however, molecular and genomic work remains imperative to identify target populations that will truly benefit.	B	high	The publication describes the results of two Phase II clinical trials (PBTC-025B and PBTC-032) involving a total of 43 patients (31 adults, 12 pediatric).

BACKGROUND: Olaparib is an oral poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor that has promising antitumor activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer and a germline BRCA mutation. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial in which olaparib monotherapy was compared with standard therapy in patients with a germline BRCA mutation and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer who had received no more than two previous chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive olaparib tablets (300 mg twice daily) or standard therapy with single-agent chemotherapy of the physician's choice (capecitabine, eribulin, or vinorelbine in 21-day cycles). The primary end point was progression-free survival, which was assessed by blinded independent central review and was analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Of the 302 patients who underwent randomization, 205 were assigned to receive olaparib and 97 were assigned to receive standard therapy. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the standard-therapy group (7.0 months vs. 4.2 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.80; P<0.001). The response rate was 59.9% in the olaparib group and 28.8% in the standard-therapy group. The rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 36.6% in the olaparib group and 50.5% in the standard-therapy group, and the rate of treatment discontinuation due to toxic effects was 4.9% and 7.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and a germline BRCA mutation, olaparib monotherapy provided a significant benefit over standard therapy; median progression-free survival was 2.8 months longer and the risk of disease progression or death was 42% lower with olaparib monotherapy than with standard therapy.

ace6a140-cd2c-56b1-bd3d-e068db31fa62	C	Detection of BCR-ABL mutations in patients with CML treated with imatinib is virtually always accompanied by clinical resistance, and mutations in the ATP phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) are associated with a poor prognosis.	Imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with acquired resistance commonly have detectable BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. It is unclear whether patients who remain sensitive to imatinib also have a significant incidence of mutations. We evaluated 144 patients treated with imatinib for BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing of 40 accelerated phase (AP), 64 late chronic phase (> or = 12 months from diagnosis, late-CP), and 40 early-CP patients. Mutations were detected in 27 patients at 17 different residues, 13 (33%) of 40 in AP, 14 (22%) of 64 in late-CP, and 0 of 40 in early-CP. Acquired resistance was evident in 24 (89%) of 27 patients with mutations. Twelve (92%) of 13 patients with mutations in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding loop (P-loop) died (median survival of 4.5 months after the mutation was detected). In contrast, only 3 (21%) of 14 patients with mutations outside the P-loop died (median follow-up of 11 months). As the detection of mutations was strongly associated with imatinib resistance, we analyzed features that predicted for their detection. Patients who commenced imatinib more than 4 years from diagnosis had a significantly higher incidence of mutations (18 [41%] of 44) compared with those treated within 4 years (9 [9%] of 100), P <.0001. Lack of a major cytogenetic response (MCR) was also associated with a higher likelihood of detecting a mutation; 19 (38%) of 50 patients without a MCR had mutations compared with 8 (8.5%) of 94 with an MCR, P <.0001. In conclusion, the detection of kinase domain mutations using a direct sequencing technique was almost always associated with imatinib resistance, and patients with mutations in the P-loop had a particularly poor prognosis.

77bfb6e4-1804-5299-8f2d-5549fc7b670d	C	Primary and secondary kinase genotypes correlate with the biological and clinical activity of sunitinib in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor.	PURPOSE: Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) harbor mutant KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) kinases, which are imatinib targets. Sunitinib, which targets KIT, PDGFRs, and several other kinases, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with GIST after they experience imatinib failure. We evaluated the impact of primary and secondary kinase genotype on sunitinib activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor responses were assessed radiologically in a phase I/II trial of sunitinib in 97 patients with metastatic, imatinib-resistant/intolerant GIST. KIT/PDGFRA mutational status was determined for 78 patients by using tumor specimens obtained before and after prior imatinib therapy. Kinase mutants were biochemically profiled for sunitinib and imatinib sensitivity. RESULTS: Clinical benefit (partial response or stable disease for > or = 6 months) with sunitinib was observed for the three most common primary GIST genotypes: KIT exon 9 (58%), KIT exon 11 (34%), and wild-type KIT/PDGFRA (56%). Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer for patients with primary KIT exon 9 mutations (P = .0005) or with a wild-type genotype (P = .0356) than for those with KIT exon 11 mutations. The same pattern was observed for overall survival (OS). PFS and OS were longer for patients with secondary KIT exon 13 or 14 mutations (which involve the KIT-adenosine triphosphate binding pocket) than for those with exon 17 or 18 mutations (which involve the KIT activation loop). Biochemical profiling studies confirmed the clinical results. CONCLUSION: The clinical activity of sunitinib after imatinib failure is significantly influenced by both primary and secondary mutations in the predominant pathogenic kinases, which has implications for optimization of the treatment of patients with GIST.

6ce9310a-acd8-5f95-b61d-e507e65638a1	D	SF3B1 mutations constitute a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer.	Mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in RNA splicing have been found to occur at relatively high frequencies in several tumour types including myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, uveal melanoma, and pancreatic cancer, and at lower frequencies in breast cancer. To investigate whether dysfunction in RNA splicing is implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, we performed a re-analysis of published exome and whole genome sequencing data. This analysis revealed that mutations in spliceosomal component genes occurred in 5.6% of unselected breast cancers, including hotspot mutations in the SF3B1 gene, which were found in 1.8% of unselected breast cancers. SF3B1 mutations were significantly associated with ER-positive disease, AKT1 mutations, and distinct copy number alterations. Additional profiling of hotspot mutations in a panel of special histological subtypes of breast cancer showed that 16% and 6% of papillary and mucinous carcinomas of the breast harboured the SF3B1 K700E mutation. RNA sequencing identified differentially spliced events expressed in tumours with SF3B1 mutations including the protein coding genes TMEM14C, RPL31, DYNL11, UQCC, and ABCC5, and the long non-coding RNA CRNDE. Moreover, SF3B1 mutant cell lines were found to be sensitive to the SF3b complex inhibitor spliceostatin A and treatment resulted in perturbation of the splicing signature. Albeit rare, SF3B1 mutations result in alternative splicing events, and may constitute drivers and a novel therapeutic target in a subset of breast cancers.	B	high	The study involves a re-analysis of published exome and whole genome sequencing data from 'unselected breast cancers' and 'a panel of special histological subtypes,' indicating analysis of primary patient data from a cohort larger than 5 patients.

ec2a2cb6-7df0-5f20-a0c7-9cf409387f62	D	ESR1 ligand-binding domain mutations in hormone-resistant breast cancer.	Seventy percent of breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER), and most of these are sensitive to ER inhibition. However, many such tumors for unknown reasons become refractory to inhibition of estrogen action in the metastatic setting. We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of two independent cohorts of metastatic ER-positive breast tumors and identified mutations in ESR1 affecting the ligand-binding domain (LBD) in 14 of 80 cases. These included highly recurrent mutations encoding p.Tyr537Ser, p.Tyr537Asn and p.Asp538Gly alterations. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the structures of the Tyr537Ser and Asp538Gly mutants involve hydrogen bonding of the mutant amino acids with Asp351, thus favoring the agonist conformation of the receptor. Consistent with this model, mutant receptors drive ER-dependent transcription and proliferation in the absence of hormone and reduce the efficacy of ER antagonists. These data implicate LBD-mutant forms of ER in mediating clinical resistance to hormonal therapy and suggest that more potent ER antagonists may be of substantial therapeutic benefit.	B	high	The study involves a comprehensive genetic analysis of two independent cohorts of metastatic ER-positive breast tumors, identifying mutations in 14 of 80 cases.

1a0a8f22-0808-5cf8-89d8-647b1bd7709c	B	Effects of KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab plus chemotherapy in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective consortium analysis.	BACKGROUND: Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. METHODS: 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. FINDINGS: 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. INTERPRETATION: While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.

d253ffa9-f550-5b9a-80a7-81d7b7dcd8c5	C	DNA-Repair Defects and Olaparib in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease, but current treatments are not based on molecular stratification. We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml. Targeted next-generation sequencing, exome and transcriptome analysis, and digital polymerase-chain-reaction testing were performed on samples from mandated tumor biopsies. RESULTS: Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; all had received prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 (58%) had received cabazitaxel. Sixteen of 49 patients who could be evaluated had a response (33%; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 48), with 12 patients receiving the study treatment for more than 6 months. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA-repair genes--including BRCA1/2, ATM, Fanconi's anemia genes, and CHEK2--in 16 of 49 patients who could be evaluated (33%). Of these 16 patients, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, including all 7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 with biallelic somatic loss, and 3 with germline mutations) and 4 of 5 with ATM aberrations. The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%. Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.

Effective targeted therapies for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), the most aggressive form of lung cancer, remain urgently needed. Here we report evidence of preclinical efficacy evoked by targeting the overexpressed cell-cycle checkpoint kinase CHK1 in SCLC. Our studies employed RNAi-mediated attenuation or pharmacologic blockade with the novel second-generation CHK1 inhibitor prexasertib (LY2606368), currently in clinical trials. In SCLC models <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, LY2606368 exhibited strong single-agent efficacy, augmented the effects of cisplatin or the PARP inhibitor olaparib, and improved the response of platinum-resistant models. Proteomic analysis identified CHK1 and MYC as top predictive biomarkers of LY2606368 sensitivity, suggesting that CHK1 inhibition may be especially effective in SCLC with <i>MYC</i> amplification or MYC protein overexpression. Our findings provide a preclinical proof of concept supporting the initiation of a clinical efficacy trial in patients with platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant relapsed SCLC. <i>Cancer Res; 77(14); 3870-84. ©2017 AACR</i>.

ca527b20-3ddc-53f1-bcdb-f0366027fb78	E	BRAF gene amplification can promote acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors in cancer cells harboring the BRAF V600E mutation.	Oncogenic BRAF mutations are found in several tumor types, including melanomas and colorectal cancers. Tumors with BRAF mutations have increased mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activity and heightened sensitivity to BRAF and MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors. To identify potential mechanisms of acquired drug resistance, we generated clones resistant to the allosteric MEK inhibitor AZD6244 from two BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer cell lines that are highly sensitive to MEK or BRAF inhibition. These AZD6244-resistant (AR) clones, which exhibited cross-resistance to BRAF inhibitors, acquired resistance through amplification of the BRAF gene. A small percentage of treatment-naïve parental cells showed preexisting BRAF amplification. We observed similar amplification in a subset of cells in a BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. In cell lines, BRAF amplification increased the abundance of phosphorylated MEK and impaired the ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation. The ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK phosphorylation in AR cells was restored by treatment with a BRAF inhibitor at low concentrations that reduced the abundance of phosphorylated MEK to amounts observed in parental cells. Combined MEK and BRAF inhibition fully overcame resistance to MEK or BRAF inhibitors alone and was also more effective in parental cells compared to treatment with either inhibitor alone. These findings implicate BRAF amplification as a mechanism of resistance to both MEK and BRAF inhibitors and suggest combined MEK and BRAF inhibition as a clinical strategy to overcome, or possibly prevent, this mechanism of resistance.	D	high	The study primarily uses in vitro cell line models to investigate the mechanism of acquired drug resistance. While it mentions observing similar amplification in a subset of cells from a BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, this appears to be an ex vivo observation supporting the cell line data rather than a clinical trial or direct patient outcome study.
a749850a-7a41-5010-97e5-51d6880ca40e	E	A systematic profile of clinical inhibitors responsive to EGFR somatic amino acid mutations in lung cancer: implication for the molecular mechanism of drug resistance and sensitivity.	Human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has become a well-established target for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, a large number of somatic mutations in such protein have been observed to cause drug resistance or sensitivity during pathological progression, limiting the application of reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in NSCLC. In the current work, we describe an integration of in silico analysis and in vitro assay to profile six representative EGFR inhibitors against a panel of 71 observed somatic mutations in EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. In the procedure, the changes in interaction free energy of inhibitors with EGFR upon various mutations were calculated one by one using a rigorous computational scheme, which was preoptimized based on a set of structure-solved, affinity-known samples to improve its performance in characterizing the EGFR-inhibitor system. This method was later demonstrated to be effective in inferring drug response to the classical L858R and G719S mutations that confer constitutive activation for the EGFR kinase. It is found that the Staurosporine, a natural product isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces staurosporeus, exhibits selective inhibitory activity on the T790M and T790M/L858R mutants. This finding was subsequently solidified by in vitro kinase assay experiment; the inhibitory IC50 values of Staurosporine against wild-type, T790M and T790M/L858R mutant EGFR were measured to be 937, 12 and 3 nM, respectively.	D	high	The study primarily relies on in silico analysis and in vitro kinase assays to investigate the inhibitory activity of compounds against EGFR mutations. The abstract explicitly mentions 'in vitro kinase assay experiment' and 'IC50 values,' which are characteristic of preclinical, in vitro models. There is no direct human patient data presented.

BACKGROUND: Multiple loss-of-function alterations in genes that are involved in DNA repair, including homologous recombination repair, are associated with response to poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition in patients with prostate and other cancers. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluating the PARP inhibitor olaparib in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent (e.g., enzalutamide or abiraterone). All the men had a qualifying alteration in prespecified genes with a direct or indirect role in homologous recombination repair. Cohort A (245 patients) had at least one alteration in <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, or <i>ATM</i>; cohort B (142 patients) had alterations in any of 12 other prespecified genes, prospectively and centrally determined from tumor tissue. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive olaparib or the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone (control). The primary end point was imaging-based progression-free survival in cohort A according to blinded independent central review. RESULTS: In cohort A, imaging-based progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the control group (median, 7.4 months vs. 3.6 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.47; P<0.001); a significant benefit was also observed with respect to the confirmed objective response rate and the time to pain progression. The median overall survival in cohort A was 18.5 months in the olaparib group and 15.1 months in the control group; 81% of the patients in the control group who had progression crossed over to receive olaparib. A significant benefit for olaparib was also seen for imaging-based progression-free survival in the overall population (cohorts A and B). Anemia and nausea were the main toxic effects in patients who received olaparib. CONCLUSIONS: In men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone and who had alterations in genes with a role in homologous recombination repair, olaparib was associated with longer progression-free survival and better measures of response and patient-reported end points than either enzalutamide or abiraterone.

1a0a8f22-0808-5cf8-89d8-647b1bd7709c	C	Effects of KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab plus chemotherapy in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective consortium analysis.	BACKGROUND: Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. METHODS: 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. FINDINGS: 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation.

PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057).

8b55ae5b-dbc1-52b3-9edc-95e620b5b930	C	Cancer immunology. Mutational landscape determines sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer.	Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which unleash a patient's own T cells to kill tumors, are revolutionizing cancer treatment. To unravel the genomic determinants of response to this therapy, we used whole-exome sequencing of non-small cell lung cancers treated with pembrolizumab, an antibody targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). In two independent cohorts, higher nonsynonymous mutation burden in tumors was associated with improved objective response, durable clinical benefit, and progression-free survival. Efficacy also correlated with the molecular smoking signature, higher neoantigen burden, and DNA repair pathway mutations; each factor was also associated with mutation burden. In one responder, neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses paralleled tumor regression, suggesting that anti-PD-1 therapy enhances neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity. Our results suggest that the genomic landscape of lung cancers shapes response to anti-PD-1 therapy.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from 'two independent cohorts' of non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with pembrolizumab.

Despite recent therapeutic advances, multiple myeloma (MM) remains largely incurable. Here we report results of a phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety and activity of autologous T cells engineered to express an affinity-enhanced T cell receptor (TCR) recognizing a naturally processed peptide shared by the cancer-testis antigens NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1. Twenty patients with antigen-positive MM received an average 2.4 × 10(9) engineered T cells 2 d after autologous stem cell transplant. Infusions were well tolerated without clinically apparent cytokine-release syndrome, despite high IL-6 levels. Engineered T cells expanded, persisted, trafficked to marrow and exhibited a cytotoxic phenotype. Persistence of engineered T cells in blood was inversely associated with NY-ESO-1 levels in the marrow. Disease progression was associated with loss of T cell persistence or antigen escape, in accordance with the expected mechanism of action of the transferred T cells. Encouraging clinical responses were observed in 16 of 20 patients (80%) with advanced disease, with a median progression-free survival of 19.1 months. NY-ESO-1-LAGE-1 TCR-engineered T cells were safe, trafficked to marrow and showed extended persistence that correlated with clinical activity against antigen-positive myeloma.

be7d919b-c94f-5a00-92b3-c755febb5512	B	Association studies of Fcγ receptor polymorphisms with outcome in HER2+ breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab in NCCTG (Alliance) Trial N9831.	Patients with HER2+ breast cancer treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy have superior survival compared with patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Polymorphisms within FCGR2A and FCGR3A are associated with binding affinity of natural killer cells to the IgG1 portion of trastuzumab, and a polymorphism in FCGR2B (I232T) is associated with impaired regulatory activity. The association of these polymorphisms with clinical response among trastuzumab-treated patients is equivocal, with both positive and negative associations. We performed genotyping analysis on the FCGR3A V158F, FCGR2A R131H, and FCGR2B I232T polymorphisms in 1,325 patients from the N9831 clinical trial. Patients in arm A (N = 419) received chemotherapy only. Patients in arms B (N = 469) and C (N = 437) were treated with chemotherapy and trastuzumab (sequentially in arm B and concurrently in arm C). Using log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models, we compared disease-free survival (DFS) among genotypic groups within pooled arms B/C. We found no differences in DFS between trastuzumab-treated patients who had the FCGR3A 158 V/V and/or FCGR2A 131 H/H high-affinity genotypes and patients without those genotypes. Furthermore, there was no significant interaction between FCGR3A and FCGR2A and treatment. However, there was a difference in DFS for FCGR2B I232T, with I/I patients deriving benefit from trastuzumab (P < 0.001), compared with the T carriers who did not (P = 0.81). The interaction between FCGR2B genotype and treatment was statistically significant (P = 0.03). Our analysis did not reveal an association between FcγR high-affinity genotypes and outcomes. However, it seems that the FCGR2B inhibitory gene may be predictive of adjuvant trastuzumab benefit.	B	high	The study performed genotyping analysis on 1,325 patients from a clinical trial (N9831) with different treatment arms.

d244d085-e08c-56e1-821c-962001276fd0	B	Afatinib versus placebo for patients with advanced, metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer after failure of erlotinib, gefitinib, or both, and one or two lines of chemotherapy (LUX-Lung 1): a phase 2b/3 randomised trial.	BACKGROUND: Afatinib, an irreversible ErbB-family blocker, has shown preclinical activity when tested in EGFR mutant models with mutations that confer resistance to EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. We aimed to assess its efficacy in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma with previous treatment failure on EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. METHODS: In this phase 2b/3 trial, we enrolled patients with stage IIIB or IV adenocarcinoma and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance (ECOG) performance score of 0-2 who had received one or two previous chemotherapy regimens and had disease progression after at least 12 weeks of treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib. We used a computer-generated sequence to randomly allocate patients (2:1) to either afatinib (50 mg per day) or placebo; all patients received best supportive care. Randomisation was done in blocks of three and was stratified by sex and baseline ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2). Investigators, patients, and the trial sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival (from date of randomisation to death), analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00656136. FINDINGS: Between May 26, 2008, and Sept 21, 2009, we identified 697 patients, 585 of whom were randomly allocated to treatment (390 to afatinib, 195 to placebo). Median overall survival was 10·8 months (95% CI 10·0-12·0) in the afatinib group and 12·0 months (10·2-14·3) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1·08, 95% CI 0·86-1·35; p=0·74). Median progression-free survival was longer in the afatinib group (3·3 months, 95% CI 2·79-4·40) than it was in the placebo group (1·1 months, 0·95-1·68; hazard ratio 0·38, 95% CI 0·31-0·48; p<0·0001). No complete responses to treatment were noted; 29 (7%) patients had a partial response in the afatinib group, as did one patient in the placebo group. Subsequent cancer treatment was given to 257 (68%) patients in the afatinib group and 153 (79%) patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse events in the afatinib group were diarrhoea (339 [87%] of 390 patients; 66 [17%] were grade 3) and rash or acne (305 [78%] patients; 56 [14%] were grade 3). These events occurred less often in the placebo group (18 [9%] of 195 patients had diarrhoea; 31 [16%] had rash or acne), all being grade 1 or 2. Drug-related serious adverse events occurred in 39 (10%) patients in the afatinib group and one (<1%) patient in the placebo group. We recorded two possibly treatment-related deaths in the afatinib group. INTERPRETATION: Although we recorded no benefit in terms of overall survival with afatinib (which might have been affected by cancer treatments given after progression in both groups), our findings for progression-free survival and response to treatment suggest that afatinib could be of some benefit to patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who have failed at least 12 weeks of previous EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment. FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim Inc.	B	high	The publication describes a phase 2b/3 randomized clinical trial involving 585 patients, comparing afatinib to placebo. It provides statistical results for overall survival and progression-free survival. This directly aligns with the definition of Level B, which includes clinical trials (Phase I-III) with primary patient data from more than 5 patients and statistical results.
b72a3c97-1b08-5eed-97dd-19321efc0237	D	HER2 activating mutations are targets for colorectal cancer treatment.	UNLABELLED: The Cancer Genome Atlas project identified HER2 somatic mutations and gene amplification in 7% of patients with colorectal cancer. Introduction of the HER2 mutations S310F, L755S, V777L, V842I, and L866M into colon epithelial cells increased signaling pathways and anchorage-independent cell growth, indicating that they are activating mutations. Introduction of these HER2 activating mutations into colorectal cancer cell lines produced resistance to cetuximab and panitumumab by sustaining MAPK phosphorylation. HER2 mutants are potently inhibited by low nanomolar doses of the irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors neratinib and afatinib. HER2 gene sequencing of 48 cetuximab-resistant, quadruple (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA) wild-type (WT) colorectal cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX) identified 4 PDXs with HER2 mutations. HER2-targeted therapies were tested on two PDXs. Treatment with a single HER2-targeted drug (trastuzumab, neratinib, or lapatinib) delayed tumor growth, but dual HER2-targeted therapy with trastuzumab plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors produced regression of these HER2-mutated PDXs. SIGNIFICANCE: HER2 activating mutations cause EGFR antibody resistance in colorectal cell lines, and PDXs with HER2 mutations show durable tumor regression when treated with dual HER2-targeted therapy. These data provide a strong preclinical rationale for clinical trials targeting HER2 activating mutations in metastatic colorectal cancer.	D	high	The study primarily uses in vitro models (colon epithelial cells, colorectal cancer cell lines) and in vivo patient-derived xenografts (PDX, which are mouse models) to investigate HER2 activating mutations and their response to targeted therapies. The abstract explicitly states that the data provide a 'strong preclinical rationale for clinical trials,' indicating that it is not direct human clinical evidence.
4c96e1d4-1fed-5fdb-86f8-7b248ad57dc7	C	Molecular Characteristics of Repotrectinib That Enable Potent Inhibition of TRK Fusion Proteins and Resistant Mutations.	<i>NTRK</i> chromosomal rearrangements yield oncogenic TRK fusion proteins that are sensitive to TRK inhibitors (larotrectinib and entrectinib) but often mutate, limiting the durability of response for <i>NTRK</i> <sup>+</sup> patients. Next-generation inhibitors with compact macrocyclic structures (repotrectinib and selitrectinib) were designed to avoid resistance mutations. Head-to-head potency comparisons of TRK inhibitors and molecular characterization of binding interactions are incomplete, obscuring a detailed understanding of how molecular characteristics translate to potency. Larotrectinib, entrectinib, selitrectinib, and repotrectinib were characterized using cellular models of wild-type TRKA/B/C fusions and resistance mutant variants with a subset evaluated in xenograft tumor models. Crystal structures were determined for repotrectinib bound to TRKA (wild-type, solvent-front mutant). TKI-naïve and pretreated case studies are presented. Repotrectinib was the most potent inhibitor of wild-type TRKA/B/C fusions and was more potent than selitrectinib against all tested resistance mutations, underscoring the importance of distinct features of the macrocycle structures. Cocrystal structures of repotrectinib with wild-type TRKA and the TRKA<sup>G595R</sup> SFM variant elucidated how differences in macrocyclic inhibitor structure, binding orientation, and conformational flexibility affect potency and mutant selectivity. The SFM crystal structure revealed an unexpected intramolecular arginine sidechain interaction. Repotrectinib caused tumor regression in <i>LMNA-NTRK1</i> xenograft models harboring GKM, SFM, xDFG, and GKM + SFM compound mutations. Durable responses were observed in TKI-naïve and -pretreated patients with <i>NTRK</i> <sup>+</sup> cancers treated with repotrectinib (NCT03093116). This comprehensive analysis of first- and second-generation TRK inhibitors informs the clinical utility, structural determinants of inhibitor potency, and design of new generations of macrocyclic inhibitors.	B	high	"The abstract describes both preclinical studies (cellular models, xenografts, crystal structures) and clinical observations. Crucially, it reports ""Durable responses were observed in TKI-naïve and -pretreated patients with NTRK+ cancers treated with repotrectinib (NCT03093116)."" The reference to a clinical trial identifier (NCT03093116) and observations in 'patients' (plural) indicates primary patient data from a clinical trial, which aligns with Level B."
cb014e76-4d62-5843-b829-83f584fbbbe0	D	Synergistic effect of SU11248 with cytarabine or daunorubicin on FLT3 ITD-positive leukemic cells.	Fetal liver tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3 ITD) mutations are the most common molecular abnormality associated with adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To exploit this molecular target, a number of potent and specific FLT3 kinase inhibitors have been developed and are currently being tested in early phase clinical trials of patients with refractory AML. To explore the efficacy of combining a FLT3 inhibitor with standard AML chemotherapy drugs, we tested the effect of combining the FLT3 inhibitor SU11248 with cytarabine or daunorubicin on the proliferation and survival of cell lines expressing either mutant (FLT3 ITD or FLT3 D835V) or wild-type (WT) FLT3. SU11248 had additive-to-synergistic inhibitory effects on FLT3-dependent leukemic cell proliferation when combined with cytarabine or daunorubicin. The synergistic interaction of SU11248 and the traditional antileukemic agents was more pronounced for induction of apoptosis. SU11248 inhibited the proliferation of primary AML myeloblasts expressing mutant FLT3 ITD but not WT FLT3 protein. Combining SU11248 and cytarabine synergistically inhibited the proliferation of primary AML myeloblasts expressing FLT3 ITD but not WT FLT3 protein. These data suggest that the addition of potent FLT3 inhibitors such as SU11248 to AML chemotherapy regimens could result in improved treatment results.	D	high	The study investigates the synergistic effect of SU11248 with chemotherapy drugs on FLT3 ITD-positive leukemic cells using cell lines and primary AML myeloblasts. This represents preclinical evidence derived from in vitro or ex vivo models, not direct human clinical data.
14eb4da2-65e1-5495-94f8-81494e180630	D	Comparison of imatinib mesylate, dasatinib (BMS-354825), and nilotinib (AMN107) in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-based mutagenesis screen: high efficacy of drug combinations.	BMS-354825 (dasatinib) and AMN107 (nilotinib) are potent alternate Abl inhibitors with activity against many imatinib mesylate-resistant BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutants, except T315I. We used N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-exposed Ba/F3-p210(BCR-ABL) cells to compare incidence and types of KD mutants emerging in the presence of imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, and nilotinib, alone and in dual combinations. Although ENU is expected to induce mutations in multiple proteins, resistant clones were almost exclusively BCR-ABL KD mutant at relevant concentrations of nilotinib and dasatinib, consistent with a central role of KD mutations for resistance to these drugs. Twenty different mutations were identified with imatinib mesylate, 10 with nilotinib (including only 1 novel mutation, E292V) and 9 with dasatinib. At intermediate drug levels the spectrum narrowed to F317V and T315I for dasatinib and Y253H, E255V, and T315I for nilotinib. Thus, cross-resistance is limited to T315I, which is also the only mutant isolated at drug concentrations equivalent to maximal achievable plasma trough levels. With drug combinations maximal suppression of resistant clone outgrowth was achieved at lower concentrations compared with single agents, suggesting that such combinations may be equipotent to higher-dose single agents. However, sequencing uniformly revealed T315I, consistent with the need for a T315I inhibitor, to completely block resistance.	D	high	The study was conducted using 'Ba/F3-p210(BCR-ABL) cells', which are in vitro cell line models. This aligns with the definition of Preclinical Evidence (Level D).
1fe1366b-471a-5489-856a-69188b232cce	D	The selective class I PI3K inhibitor CH5132799 targets human cancers harboring oncogenic PIK3CA mutations.	PURPOSE: The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway plays a central role in cell proliferation and survival in human cancer. PIK3CA mutations, which are found in many cancer patients, activate the PI3K pathway, resulting in cancer development and progression. We previously identified CH5132799 as a novel PI3K inhibitor. Thus, this study aimed to clarify the biochemical and antitumor activity of CH5132799 and elucidate the correlation between CH5132799 response and genetic alterations in the PI3K pathway. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Kinase inhibitory activity was profiled in cell-free assays. A large panel of human breast, ovarian, prostate, and endometrial cancer cell lines, as well as xenograft models, were used to evaluate the antitumor activity of CH5132799, followed by analysis for genetic alterations. Effects on Akt phosphorylation induced by mTORC1 inhibition were tested with CH5132799 and compared with mTORC1 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. RESULTS: CH5132799 selectively inhibited class I PI3Ks and PI3Kα mutants in in vitro kinase assays. Tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations were significantly sensitive to CH5132799 in vitro and were remarkably regressed by CH5132799 in in vivo mouse xenograft models. In combination with trastuzumab, tumors disappeared in the trastuzumab-insensitive breast cancer model with the PIK3CA mutation. Moreover, CH5132799 did not reverse a negative feedback loop of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and induced regression against tumors regrown after long-term mTORC1 inhibitor treatment. CONCLUSIONS: CH5132799 is a selective class I PI3K inhibitor with potent antitumor activity against tumors harboring the PIK3CA mutations. Prediction of CH5132799 response on the basis of PIK3CA mutations could enable patient stratification in clinical settings.	D	high	The study exclusively uses in vitro models (cell-free assays, human cancer cell lines) and in vivo mouse xenograft models to evaluate the biochemical and antitumor activity of CH5132799. There is no direct human patient data or clinical trial evidence presented.
0f6ce878-d925-5590-9d5b-322d73b94f16	C	Bosutinib is active in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia after imatinib and dasatinib and/or nilotinib therapy failure.	Bosutinib, a dual Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has shown potent activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This phase 1/2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily bosutinib 500 mg in leukemia patients after resistance/intolerance to imatinib. The current analysis included 118 patients with chronic-phase CML who had been pretreated with imatinib followed by dasatinib and/or nilotinib, with a median follow-up of 28.5 months. In this subpopulation, major cytogenetic response was attained by 32% of patients; complete cytogenetic response was attained by 24%, including in one of 3 patients treated with 3 prior TKIs. Complete hematologic response was achieved/maintained in 73% of patients. On-treatment transformation to accelerated/blast phase occurred in 5 patients. At 2 years, Kaplan-Meier-estimated progression-free survival was 73% and estimated overall survival was 83%. Responses were seen across Bcr-Abl mutations, including those associated with dasatinib and nilotinib resistance, except T315I. Bosutinib had an acceptable safety profile; treatment-emergent adverse events were primarily manageable grade 1/2 gastrointestinal events and rash. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic adverse events (> 2% of patients) included diarrhea (8%) and rash (4%). Bosutinib may offer a new treatment option for patients with chronic-phase CML after treatment with multiple TKIs. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00261846.	B	high	This is a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bosutinib in 118 human patients with chronic-phase CML.

3bfd25a3-5e32-5cb4-8b94-94913772f547	D	ALK mutations conferring differential resistance to structurally diverse ALK inhibitors.	PURPOSE: EML4-ALK fusions define a subset of lung cancers that can be effectively treated with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors. Unfortunately, the duration of response is heterogeneous and acquired resistance limits their ultimate efficacy. Thus, a better understanding of resistance mechanisms will help to enhance tumor control in EML4-ALK-positive tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: By applying orthogonal functional mutagenesis screening approaches, we screened for mutations inducing resistance to the aminopyridine PF02341066 (crizotinib) and/or the diaminopyrimidine TAE684. RESULTS: Here, we show that the resistance mutation, L1196M, as well as other crizotinib resistance mutations (F1174L and G1269S), are highly sensitive to the structurally unrelated ALK inhibitor TAE684. In addition, we identified two novel EML4-ALK resistance mutations (L1198P and D1203N), which unlike previously reported mutations, induced resistance to both ALK inhibitors. An independent resistance screen in ALK-mutant neuroblastoma cells yielded the same L1198P resistance mutation but defined two additional mutations conferring resistance to TAE684 but not to PF02341066. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that different ALK resistance mutations as well as different ALK inhibitors impact the therapeutic efficacy in the setting of EML4-ALK fusions and ALK mutations.

There are few effective treatments for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We present a patient with recurrent GBM who achieved a prolonged response to treatment with afatinib, an irreversible ErbB family blocker, plus temozolomide. A 58-year-old female patient was diagnosed with multifocal primary GBM. After surgical resection, first-line therapy comprised radiotherapy and temozolomide. Following disease progression after 3 temozolomide cycles, the patient entered a phase I/II clinical trial of afatinib (20-40 mg daily for 28 days) plus temozolomide (50 mg/m2 every 21/28 days). Next-generation sequencing analysis of the brain tumor specimen was performed. At the last assessment, 63 treatment cycles had been completed and the patient had survived for ~5 years since recurrence. Significant disease regression was observed after 5 cycles and was maintained during long-term follow-up. Adverse events were consistent with the known tolerability profile of afatinib and were managed by treatment interruption/dose reduction. The patient had several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) aberrations, including gene amplification and EGFRvIII positivity. Three somatic mutations were identified, including an unprecedented extracellular-domain substitution (D247Y). The patient has survived ~6-fold longer than normally expected in patients with recurrent GBM. The complex EGFR genotype may underlie sustained response to afatinib plus temozolomide.

96154ef4-3541-5c0a-b2a1-20caa06ab00e	D	Relationship between Tumor Biomarkers and Efficacy in EMILIA, a Phase III Study of Trastuzumab Emtansine in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.	PURPOSE: HER2-positive breast cancer is heterogeneous. Some tumors express mutations, like activating PIK3CA mutations or reduced PTEN expression, that negatively correlate with response to HER2-targeted therapies. In this exploratory analysis, we investigated whether the efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate comprised of the cytotoxic agent DM1 linked to the HER2-targeted antibody trastuzumab, was correlated with the expression of specific biomarkers in the phase III EMILIA study. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumors were evaluated for HER2 (n = 866), EGFR (n = 832), and HER3 (n = 860) mRNA expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR; for PTEN protein expression (n = 271) by IHC; and for PIK3CA mutations (n = 259) using a mutation detection kit. Survival outcomes were analyzed by biomarker subgroups. T-DM1 was also tested on cell lines and in breast cancer xenograft models containing PIK3CA mutations. RESULTS: Longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed with T-DM1 compared with capecitabine plus lapatinib in all biomarker subgroups. PIK3CA mutations were associated with shorter median PFS (mutant vs. wild type: 4.3 vs. 6.4 months) and OS (17.3 vs. 27.8 months) in capecitabine plus lapatinib-treated patients, but not in T-DM1-treated patients (PFS, 10.9 vs. 9.8 months; OS, not reached in mutant or wild type). T-DM1 showed potent activity in cell lines and xenograft models with PIK3CA mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Although other standard HER2-directed therapies are less effective in tumors with PI3KCA mutations, T-DM1 appears to be effective in both PI3KCA-mutated and wild-type tumors. Clin Cancer Res; 22(15); 3755-63. ©2016 AACR.	A	high	The study is an exploratory analysis of biomarker correlations conducted within the EMILIA Phase III clinical trial.

f550877d-9b52-58aa-aee1-88472214a5de	D	Poly (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibition: A potential treatment of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.	Poly (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, first evaluated nearly a decade ago, are primarily used in malignancies with known defects in DNA repair genes, such as alterations in breast cancer, early onset 1/2 (BRCA1/2). While no specific mutations in BRCA1/2 have been reported in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), MPNST cells could be effectively targeted with a PARP inhibitor to drive cells to synthetic lethality due to their complex karyotype and high level of inherent genomic instability. In this study, we assessed the expression levels of PARP1 and PARP2 in MPNST patient tumor samples and correlated these findings with overall survival. We also determined the level of PARP activity in MPNST cell lines. In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of the PARP inhibitor AZD2281 (Olaparib) in MPNST cell lines. We observed decreased MPNST cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in vitro at doses similar to, or less than, the doses used in cell lines with established defective DNA repair genes. Furthermore, AZD2281 significantly reduced local growth of MPNST xenografts, decreased the development of macroscopic lung metastases, and increased survival of mice with metastatic disease. Our results suggest that AZD2281 could be an effective therapeutic option in MPNST and should be further investigated for its potential clinical use in this malignancy.	D	high	The study primarily evaluates the efficacy of the PARP inhibitor AZD2281 (Olaparib) in in vitro MPNST cell lines and in vivo MPNST xenograft models in mice. These are preclinical models, not direct human evidence of treatment efficacy. While patient tumor samples were used to assess PARP1/2 expression, the therapeutic intervention's effectiveness was demonstrated in non-human systems.
b544bd80-6b2f-5cfd-8cbf-ba9ab4ec7708	D	Ponatinib inhibits polyclonal drug-resistant KIT oncoproteins and shows therapeutic potential in heavily pretreated gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients.	PURPOSE: KIT is the major oncogenic driver of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib are approved therapies; however, efficacy is often limited by the acquisition of polyclonal secondary resistance mutations in KIT, with those located in the activation (A) loop (exons 17/18) being particularly problematic. Here, we explore the KIT-inhibitory activity of ponatinib in preclinical models and describe initial characterization of its activity in patients with GIST. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cellular and in vivo activities of ponatinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib against mutant KIT were evaluated using an accelerated mutagenesis assay and a panel of engineered and GIST-derived cell lines. The ponatinib-KIT costructure was also determined. The clinical activity of ponatinib was examined in three patients with GIST previously treated with all three FDA-approved agents. RESULTS: In engineered and GIST-derived cell lines, ponatinib potently inhibited KIT exon 11 primary mutants and a range of secondary mutants, including those within the A-loop. Ponatinib also induced regression in engineered and GIST-derived tumor models containing these secondary mutations. In a mutagenesis screen, 40 nmol/L ponatinib was sufficient to suppress outgrowth of all secondary mutants except V654A, which was suppressed at 80 nmol/L. This inhibitory profile could be rationalized on the basis of structural analyses. Ponatinib (30 mg daily) displayed encouraging clinical activity in two of three patients with GIST. CONCLUSION: Ponatinib possesses potent activity against most major clinically relevant KIT mutants and has demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity in patients with refractory GIST. These data strongly support further evaluation of ponatinib in patients with GIST.	C	high	The study includes both preclinical evidence (in vitro and in vivo models) and clinical observations. The clinical component involves a very small patient series of three patients, which falls under the definition of a 'Case Study' (less than 5 patients).
64cc1768-a835-5a3c-ac4b-001e8fd55df3	D	KDR activating mutations in human angiosarcomas are sensitive to specific kinase inhibitors.	Angiosarcomas (AS) represent a heterogeneous group of malignant vascular tumors occurring not only in different anatomic locations but also in distinct clinical settings, such as radiation or associated chronic lymphedema. Although representing only 1% to 2% of soft tissue sarcomas, vascular sarcomas provide unique insight into the general process of tumor angiogenesis. However, no molecular candidates have been identified to guide a specific therapeutic intervention. By expression profiling, AS show distinct up-regulation of vascular-specific receptor tyrosine kinases, including TIE1, KDR, SNRK, TEK, and FLT1. Full sequencing of these five candidate genes identified 10% of patients harboring KDR mutations. A KDR-positive genotype was associated with strong KDR protein expression and was restricted to the breast anatomic site with or without prior exposure to radiation. Transient transfection of KDR mutants into COS-7 cells showed ligand-independent activation of the kinase, which was inhibited by specific KDR inhibitors. These data provide a basis for the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-directed therapy in the treatment of primary and radiation-induced AS.	B	high	The abstract describes '10% of patients harboring KDR mutations' and associations of KDR-positive genotype with specific clinical features. This indicates the use of primary patient data, likely from a cohort larger than a few individuals, which aligns with Level B criteria for 'primary patient data with >5 patients'. While the exact number of patients is not specified, the percentage implies a study cohort. The study also includes preclinical in vitro experiments (COS-7 cells) to validate the findings, which supports the clinical observations.
62f24922-0cec-54cf-8c98-fd9501b5b01f	C	Dasatinib induces significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase.	Treatment options are limited for patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-AP). Dasatinib is a novel, potent, oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC-family kinases that showed marked efficacy in a phase 1 trial of patients with imatinib-resistant CML. Results are presented for 107 patients with CML-AP with imatinib-resistance or -intolerance from a phase 2, open-label study further evaluating dasatinib efficacy and safety. At 8 months' minimum follow-up, 81%, 64%, and 39% of patients achieved overall, major (MaHR), and complete hematologic responses, respectively, whereas 33% and 24% attained major and complete cytogenetic remission. Of 69 patients who achieved MaHR, 7 progressed. Seventy-six percent of patients are estimated to be alive and progression-free at 10 months. Response rates for the 60% of patients with baseline BCR-ABL mutations did not differ from the total population. Dasatinib was well tolerated: most nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate; no imatinib-intolerant patients discontinued dasatinib because of AEs. Although common (76% of patients with severe neutropenia), cytopenias were manageable through dose modification. In summary, dasatinib induced significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance, was well tolerated, and may represent a potent new therapeutic option for CML-AP. Further follow-up is warranted. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #CA180005.	B	high	The abstract explicitly states that the results are from a 'phase 2, open-label study' involving 107 patients.

9d5a1a89-0a59-571d-878a-3755e991089d	B	Improved survival with MEK inhibition in BRAF-mutated melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Activating mutations in serine-threonine protein kinase B-RAF (BRAF) are found in 50% of patients with advanced melanoma. Selective BRAF-inhibitor therapy improves survival, as compared with chemotherapy, but responses are often short-lived. In previous trials, MEK inhibition appeared to be promising in this population. METHODS: In this phase 3 open-label trial, we randomly assigned 322 patients who had metastatic melanoma with a V600E or V600K BRAF mutation to receive either trametinib, an oral selective MEK inhibitor, or chemotherapy in a 2:1 ratio. Patients received trametinib (2 mg orally) once daily or intravenous dacarbazine (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area) or paclitaxel (175 mg per square meter) every 3 weeks. Patients in the chemotherapy group who had disease progression were permitted to cross over to receive trametinib. Progression-free survival was the primary end point, and overall survival was a secondary end point. RESULTS: Median progression-free survival was 4.8 months in the trametinib group and 1.5 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death in the trametinib group, 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 0.63; P<0.001). At 6 months, the rate of overall survival was 81% in the trametinib group and 67% in the chemotherapy group despite crossover (hazard ratio for death, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.92; P=0.01). Rash, diarrhea, and peripheral edema were the most common toxic effects in the trametinib group and were managed with dose interruption and dose reduction; asymptomatic and reversible reduction in the cardiac ejection fraction and ocular toxic effects occurred infrequently. Secondary skin neoplasms were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Trametinib, as compared with chemotherapy, improved rates of progression-free and overall survival among patients who had metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. (Funded by GlaxoSmithKline; METRIC ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01245062.).	A	high	The study is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial involving 322 patients. It directly compares trametinib to chemotherapy and demonstrates improved progression-free and overall survival, providing strong, practice-changing evidence consistent with a Level A classification.
2d23acce-4b84-5d93-bcca-b5fe00168fbb	D	Negative feedback-defective PRPS1 mutants drive thiopurine resistance in relapsed childhood ALL.	Relapse is the leading cause of mortality in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Among chemotherapeutics, thiopurines are key drugs in ALL combination therapy. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified relapse-specific mutations in the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 gene (PRPS1), which encodes a rate-limiting purine biosynthesis enzyme, in 24/358 (6.7%) relapsed childhood B cell ALL (B-ALL) cases. All individuals who harbored PRPS1 mutations relapsed early during treatment, and mutated ALL clones expanded exponentially before clinical relapse. Our functional analyses of PRPS1 mutants uncovered a new chemotherapy-resistance mechanism involving reduced feedback inhibition of de novo purine biosynthesis and competitive inhibition of thiopurine activation. Notably, the de novo purine synthesis inhibitor lometrexol effectively abrogated PRPS1 mutant-driven drug resistance. These results highlight the importance of constitutive activation of the de novo purine synthesis pathway in thiopurine resistance, and they offer therapeutic strategies for the treatment of relapsed and thiopurine-resistant ALL.	B	high	The study identified relapse-specific mutations in PRPS1 in 24/358 (6.7%) relapsed childhood B-ALL cases, which constitutes primary patient data with more than 5 patients.

6d30f753-40f5-5577-be49-36a445dfc2cb	B	Valproic acid in combination with all-trans retinoic acid and intensive therapy for acute myeloid leukemia in older patients.	The outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia who are older than 60 years has remained poor because of unfavorable disease characteristics and patient-related factors. The randomized German-Austrian AML Study Group 06-04 protocol was designed on the basis of in vitro synergistic effects of valproic acid (VPA) and all-trans retinoic acid with chemotherapy. Between 2004 and 2006, 186 patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 induction cycles with idarubicin, cytarabine, and all-trans retinoic acid either with VPA or without (STANDARD). In all patients, consolidation therapy was intended. Complete remission rates after induction tended to be lower in VPA compared with STANDARD (40% vs 52%; P = .14) as a result of a higher early death rate (26% vs 14%; P = .06). The main toxicities attributed to VPA were delayed hematologic recovery and grade 3/4 infections, observed predominantly during the second induction cycle. After restricting VPA to the first induction cycle and reducing the dose of idarubicin, these toxicities dropped to rates observed in STANDARD. After a median follow-up time of 84 months, event-free and overall survival were not different between the 2 groups (P = .95 and P = .57, respectively). However, relapse-free-survival was significantly superior in VPA compared with STANDARD (24.4% vs 6.4% at 5 years; P = .02). Explorative subset analyses revealed that AML with mutated Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) may particularly benefit from VPA. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00151255.

5bb87079-f600-5ed7-b0da-fec016ab74dc	D	Selective Inhibition of Oncogenic KRAS Output with Small Molecules Targeting the Inactive State.	"UNLABELLED: KRAS gain-of-function mutations occur in approximately 30% of all human cancers. Despite more than 30 years of KRAS-focused research and development efforts, no targeted therapy has been discovered for cancers with KRAS mutations. Here, we describe ARS-853, a selective, covalent inhibitor of KRAS(G12C) that inhibits mutant KRAS-driven signaling by binding to the GDP-bound oncoprotein and preventing activation. Based on the rates of engagement and inhibition observed for ARS-853, along with a mutant-specific mass spectrometry-based assay for assessing KRAS activation status, we show that the nucleotide state of KRAS(G12C) is in a state of dynamic flux that can be modulated by upstream signaling factors. These studies provide convincing evidence that the KRAS(G12C) mutation generates a ""hyperexcitable"" rather than a ""statically active"" state and that targeting the inactive, GDP-bound form is a promising approach for generating novel anti-RAS therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE: A cell-active, mutant-specific, covalent inhibitor of KRAS(G12C) is described that targets the GDP-bound, inactive state and prevents subsequent activation. Using this novel compound, we demonstrate that KRAS(G12C) oncoprotein rapidly cycles bound nucleotide and responds to upstream signaling inputs to maintain a highly active state."	D	high	The abstract describes the development and characterization of a novel small molecule inhibitor (ARS-853) for KRAS(G12C) and its mechanism of action.

1a0a8f22-0808-5cf8-89d8-647b1bd7709c	C	Effects of KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab plus chemotherapy in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective consortium analysis.	BACKGROUND: Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. METHODS: 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. FINDINGS: 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. INTERPRETATION: While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.

e40b311d-b83f-5d96-b43a-7e5895f19230	D	Antitumor activity of BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in preclinical models of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.	The protein kinase BRAF is a key component of the RAS-RAF signaling pathway which plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in BRAF at codon 600 promote catalytic activity and are associated with 8% of all human (solid) tumors, including 8% to 10% of colorectal cancers (CRC). Here, we report the preclinical characterization of vemurafenib (RG7204; PLX4032; RO5185426), a first-in-class, specific small molecule inhibitor of BRAF(V600E) in BRAF-mutated CRC cell lines and tumor xenograft models. As a single agent, vemurafenib shows dose-dependent inhibition of ERK and MEK phosphorylation, thereby arresting cell proliferation in BRAF(V600)-expressing cell lines and inhibiting tumor growth in BRAF(V600E) bearing xenograft models. Because vemurafenib has shown limited single-agent clinical activity in BRAF(V600E)-mutant metastatic CRC, we therefore explored a range of combination therapies, with both standard agents and targeted inhibitors in preclinical xenograft models. In a BRAF-mutant CRC xenograft model with de novo resistance to vemurafenib (RKO), tumor growth inhibition by vemurafenib was enhanced by combining with an AKT inhibitor (MK-2206). The addition of vemurafenib to capecitabine and/or bevacizumab, cetuximab and/or irinotecan, or erlotinib resulted in increased antitumor activity and improved survival in xenograft models. Together, our findings suggest that the administration of vemurafenib in combination with standard-of-care or novel targeted therapies may lead to enhanced and sustained clinical antitumor efficacy in CRCs harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation.	D	high	The study describes 'preclinical characterization' using 'BRAF-mutated CRC cell lines' and 'tumor xenograft models,' which are in vitro and in vivo models, respectively.

c58723d4-7dff-5abe-8d12-2bd780587a59	D	TIMP1 overexpression mediates resistance of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells to fulvestrant and down-regulates progesterone receptor expression.	High levels of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP1) are associated with poor prognosis, reduced response to chemotherapy, and, potentially, also poor response to endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients. Our objective was to further investigate the hypothesis that TIMP1 is associated with endocrine sensitivity. We established a panel of 11 MCF-7 subclones with a wide range of TIMP1 mRNA and protein expression levels. Cells with high expression of TIMP1 versus low TIMP1 displayed significantly reduced sensitivity to the antiestrogen fulvestrant (ICI 182,780, Faslodex®), while TIMP1 levels did not influence the sensitivity to 4-hydroxytamoxifen. An inverse correlation between expression of the progesterone receptor and TIMP1 was found, but TIMP1 levels did not correlate with estrogen receptor levels or growth-promoting effects of estrogen (estradiol, E2). Additionally, the effects of fulvestrant, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, or estrogen on estrogen receptor expression were not associated with TIMP1 levels. Gene expression analyses revealed associations between expression of TIMP1 and genes involved in metabolic pathways, epidermal growth factor receptor 1/cancer signaling pathways, and cell cycle. Gene and protein expression analyses showed no general defects in estrogen receptor signaling except from lack of progesterone receptor expression and estrogen inducibility in clones with high TIMP1. The present study suggests a relation between high expression level of TIMP1 and loss of progesterone receptor expression combined with fulvestrant resistance. Our findings in vitro may have clinical implications as the data suggest that high tumor levels of TIMP1 may be a predictive biomarker for reduced response to fulvestrant.	D	high	The study describes experiments conducted on 'MCF-7 subclones' and explicitly states 'Our findings in vitro may have clinical implications'. This indicates a preclinical study using cell line models, which falls under Level D.
c76b34d3-70f9-549e-93cc-399b7e1d9ac4	B	Evaluation of the association of PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss with efficacy of trastuzumab therapy in metastatic breast cancer.	Trastuzumab (T) is effective in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with HER2 overexpression and/or amplification, but resistance to T develops in a significant number of HER2-positive patients. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance is critical to the care of these patients. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were collected from 256 patients with T-treated MBC. Clinical information was collected retrospectively from the patients' medical records. Central review of HER2 status by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that of the 227 eligible patients only 139 (61%) were truly HER2-positive. PTEN, ER, PgR, and Ki67 were evaluated by IHC, while PTEN status was evaluated by FISH as well. PIK3CA mutations were identified with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Median time to progression (TTP) was 14.4 months for the HER2-positive and 10.3 for the HER2-negative patients (log-rank, P = 0.22). Survival from the initiation of T (survivalT) was 50.4 months for the HER2-positive and 35.3 for the HER2-negative subgroups (P = 0.006). Higher risk of progression was associated with HER2-positive status and the presence of PIK3CA mutations (P = 0.014). PTEN loss, as determined by IHC, was associated with lower survivalT in the whole population (P = 0.029) and in the HER2-positive population (P = 0.017). PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss status were evaluated together as a single parameter, to estimate the impact of activation of the PI3K/AKT molecular pathway, and it was significantly associated with both decreased TTP (P = 0.003 in the total population, P = 0.004 in HER2-positive patients) and survival (survivalT, P = 0.011 in total, P = 0.006 in HER2-positive). In this trastuzumab-treated breast cancer population, PIK3CA activating mutations were associated with shorter TTP and PTEN loss with decreased survival. The activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway from either defect was associated with both TTP and survival, indicating the adverse effect of this pathway's status on trastuzumab efficacy.	B	high	This study is a retrospective analysis of primary patient data from 256 individuals with metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab. It involves molecular analysis of tumor samples and correlation with clinical outcomes (time to progression and survival), providing statistical results. This fits the definition of Level B, which includes 'primary patient data with >5 patients' and 'statistical results but less definitive than Level A'. It is not a prospective clinical trial (Level A) but provides strong clinical evidence from a substantial patient cohort.
e5eccf3d-ba3c-5bd5-9ca3-d6da5114e5e2	D	Ribociclib, a Cdk4/Cdk6 kinase inhibitor, enhances glucocorticoid sensitivity in B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-All).	Dysregulation of the cyclin D1-CDK4/CDK6 complex is frequently observed in almost all human cancer and contributes to aberrant cell proliferation and consequent tumorigenesis. Although many reports described the importance of CDK4/CDK6 in different set of human tumors, only few studies have been performed on leukemia. By gene expression analysis performed in a cohort of childhood patients affected by B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) we found that both CDK4 and CDK6 are highly expressed. Moreover, reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis showed that cyclin D1 levels are higher in patients undergoing relapse. Starting from these considerations, we evaluated the effect of dual inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 in B-ALL and if this inhibition could enhance cytotoxic killing of leukemia cells after combination treatment with dexamethasone. We treated B-ALL cell lines with ribociclib, a highly specific CDK4/6 inhibitor. As expected, treatment with ribociclib induced growth inhibition of B-ALL cell lines, accompanied by strong cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, along with a dose-dependent decrease in phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein. Ribociclib exposure strongly synergizes with dexamethasone in SEM and RCH-ACV, two dexamethasone-resistant cell lines, along with a strong decrease in proliferation and a significant increase in apoptotic cell death. These results were also confirmed on primary cultures derived from bone marrow of pediatric patients affected by B-ALL. Immunoblot analysis showed a significant increase in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) along with some of its target genes, after combined treatment with ribociclib and dexamethasone. Altogether our findings support the concept that pharmacologic inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 may represent a useful therapeutic strategy to control cell proliferation in B-ALL and provide new insight in understanding potential mechanism of glucocorticoid resistance.	D	high	The study primarily investigates the effects of ribociclib on B-ALL cell lines and primary cultures derived from pediatric patients. While initial gene expression and protein array analyses were performed on patient cohorts, the core experimental evidence for the therapeutic strategy (dual inhibition with ribociclib and dexamethasone) is derived from in vitro models (cell lines and primary cultures), which falls under preclinical evidence.
5a5e703b-2908-50bd-8dca-3618a4fb3ff1	C	PIK3CA mutations in colorectal cancer are associated with clinical resistance to EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies.	The monoclonal antibodies (moAb) panitumumab and cetuximab target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and have proven valuable for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). EGFR-mediated signaling involves two main intracellular cascades: on one side KRAS activates BRAF, which in turn triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinases. On the other, membrane localization of the lipid kinase PIK3CA counteracts PTEN and promotes AKT1 phosphorylation, thereby activating a parallel intracellular axis. Constitutive activation of KRAS bypasses the corresponding signaling cascade and, accordingly, patients with mCRC bearing KRAS mutations are clinically resistant to therapy with panitumumab or cetuximab. We hypothesized that mutations activating PIK3CA could also preclude responsiveness to EGFR-targeted moAbs through a similar mechanism. Here, we present the mutational analysis of PIK3CA and KRAS and evaluation of the PTEN protein status in a cohort of 110 patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR moAbs. We observed 15 (13.6%) PIK3CA and 32 (29.0%) KRAS mutations. PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with clinical resistance to panitumumab or cetuximab; none of the mutated patients achieved objective response (P = 0.038). When only KRAS wild-type tumors were analyzed, the statistical correlation was stronger (P = 0.016). Patients with PIK3CA mutations displayed a worse clinical outcome also in terms of progression-free survival (P = 0.035). Our data indicate that PIK3CA mutations can independently hamper the therapeutic response to panitumumab or cetuximab in mCRC. When the molecular status of the PIK3CA/PTEN and KRAS pathways are concomitantly ascertained, up to 70% of mCRC patients unlikely to respond to EGFR moAbs can be identified.	B	high	The study analyzes primary patient data from a cohort of 110 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. It presents statistical results regarding the association between PIK3CA mutations and clinical resistance, including P-values for objective response and progression-free survival. This aligns with the definition of Level B, which includes clinical trials (Phase I-III) or primary patient data with >5 patients and statistical results, but is less definitive than Level A.

Purpose Although IKZF1 deletion ( IKZF1<sup>del</sup>) confers a higher risk of relapse in childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), it is uncertain whether treatment intensification will reverse this risk and improve outcomes. The Malaysia-Singapore ALL 2010 study (MS2010) prospectively upgraded the risk assignment of patients with IKZF1<sup>del</sup> to the next highest level and added imatinib to the treatment of all patients with BCR- ABL1 fusion. Patients and Methods In total, 823 patients with B-ALL treated in the Malyasia-Singapore ALL 2003 study (MS2003; n = 507) and MS2010 (n = 316) were screened for IKZF1<sup>del</sup> using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay. The impact of IKZF1<sup>del</sup> on the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was compared between the two studies. Results Patient characteristics were similar in both cohorts, including IKZF1<sup>del</sup> frequencies (59 of 410 [14.4%] v 50 of 275 [18.2%]; P = .2). In MS2003, where IKZF1<sup>del</sup> was not used in risk assignment, IKZF1<sup>del</sup> conferred a significantly higher 5-year CIR (30.4% v 8.1%; P = 8.7 × 10<sup>-7</sup>), particularly in the intermediate-risk group who lacked high-risk features (25.0% v 7.5%; P = .01). For patients with BCR-ABL1-negative disease, IKZF1<sup>del</sup> conferred a higher 5-year CIR (20.5% v 8.0%; P = .01). In MS2010, the 5-year CIR of patients with IKZF1<sup>del</sup> significantly decreased to 13.5% ( P = .05) and no longer showed a significant difference in patients with BCR-ABL1-negative disease (11.4% v 4.4%; P = .09). The 5-year overall survival for patients with IKZF1<sup>del</sup> improved from 69.6% in MS2003 to 91.6% in MS2010 ( P = .007). Conclusion Intensifying therapy for childhood B-ALL with IKZF1<sup>del</sup> significantly reduced the risk of relapse and improved overall survival. Incorporating IKZF1<sup>del</sup> screening significantly improved treatment outcomes in contemporary ALL therapy.	A	high	This study compares two large prospective cohorts (MS2003 and MS2010) of childhood B-ALL patients, totaling 823 individuals. The MS2010 study prospectively implemented an intensified treatment strategy for patients with IKZF1 deletion. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in relapse and a significant improvement in overall survival for patients with IKZF1 deletion in the MS2010 cohort compared to MS2003. The large patient numbers, prospective design, and clear, statistically significant improvement in clinical outcomes (relapse and overall survival) suggest that this evidence is practice-changing, aligning with Level A criteria.

Relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) carries a poor prognosis, despite intensive retreatment, owing to intrinsic drug resistance. The biological pathways that mediate resistance are unknown. Here, we report the transcriptome profiles of matched diagnosis and relapse bone marrow specimens from ten individuals with pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia using RNA sequencing. Transcriptome sequencing identified 20 newly acquired, novel nonsynonymous mutations not present at initial diagnosis, with 2 individuals harboring relapse-specific mutations in the same gene, NT5C2, encoding a 5'-nucleotidase. Full-exon sequencing of NT5C2 was completed in 61 further relapse specimens, identifying additional mutations in 5 cases. Enzymatic analysis of mutant proteins showed that base substitutions conferred increased enzymatic activity and resistance to treatment with nucleoside analog therapies. Clinically, all individuals who harbored NT5C2 mutations relapsed early, within 36 months of initial diagnosis (P = 0.03). These results suggest that mutations in NT5C2 are associated with the outgrowth of drug-resistant clones in ALL.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from a cohort of 71 individuals with pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia, identifying relapse-specific mutations and correlating them with clinical outcomes (early relapse, P = 0.03).

b544bd80-6b2f-5cfd-8cbf-ba9ab4ec7708	D	Ponatinib inhibits polyclonal drug-resistant KIT oncoproteins and shows therapeutic potential in heavily pretreated gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients.	PURPOSE: KIT is the major oncogenic driver of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib are approved therapies; however, efficacy is often limited by the acquisition of polyclonal secondary resistance mutations in KIT, with those located in the activation (A) loop (exons 17/18) being particularly problematic. Here, we explore the KIT-inhibitory activity of ponatinib in preclinical models and describe initial characterization of its activity in patients with GIST. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cellular and in vivo activities of ponatinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib against mutant KIT were evaluated using an accelerated mutagenesis assay and a panel of engineered and GIST-derived cell lines. The ponatinib-KIT costructure was also determined. The clinical activity of ponatinib was examined in three patients with GIST previously treated with all three FDA-approved agents. RESULTS: In engineered and GIST-derived cell lines, ponatinib potently inhibited KIT exon 11 primary mutants and a range of secondary mutants, including those within the A-loop. Ponatinib also induced regression in engineered and GIST-derived tumor models containing these secondary mutations. In a mutagenesis screen, 40 nmol/L ponatinib was sufficient to suppress outgrowth of all secondary mutants except V654A, which was suppressed at 80 nmol/L. This inhibitory profile could be rationalized on the basis of structural analyses. Ponatinib (30 mg daily) displayed encouraging clinical activity in two of three patients with GIST. CONCLUSION: Ponatinib possesses potent activity against most major clinically relevant KIT mutants and has demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity in patients with refractory GIST. These data strongly support further evaluation of ponatinib in patients with GIST.	C	high	The study includes extensive preclinical (in vitro and in vivo) data, which would be Level D. However, it also reports on the clinical activity of ponatinib in three human patients. This 'very small patient series (<5 patients)' directly aligns with the definition of Level C evidence.

"""Liquid biopsy"" approaches analyzing cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from the blood of patients with cancer are increasingly utilized in clinical practice. However, it is not yet known whether cfDNA sequencing from large cohorts of patients with cancer can detect genomic alterations at frequencies similar to those observed by direct tumor sequencing, and whether this approach can generate novel insights. Here, we report next-generation sequencing data from cfDNA of 1,397 patients with colorectal cancer. Overall, frequencies of genomic alterations detected in cfDNA were comparable to those observed in three independent tissue-based colorectal cancer sequencing compendia. Our analysis also identified a novel cluster of extracellular domain (ECD) mutations in <i>EGFR</i>, mediating resistance by blocking binding of anti-EGFR antibodies. Patients with <i>EGFR</i> ECD mutations displayed striking tumor heterogeneity, with 91% harboring multiple distinct resistance alterations (range, 1-13; median, 4). These results suggest that cfDNA profiling can effectively define the genomic landscape of cancer and yield important biological insights.<b>Significance:</b> This study provides one of the first examples of how large-scale genomic profiling of cfDNA from patients with colorectal cancer can detect genomic alterations at frequencies comparable to those observed by direct tumor sequencing.

We compared the growth-inhibitory effects and inhibition profile of the SRC family kinases (SFKs) of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and INNO-406. Dasatinib exhibited the strongest potency against BCR-ABL with little selectivity over SFKs. Nilotinib exhibited a weaker affinity than the other inhibitors, but was highly specific for ABL and may be useful for the treatment of P-glycoprotein overexpressing leukemic cells. INNO-406 had an intermediate affinity for BCR-ABL between that of dasatinib and nilotinib, and inhibited only SFKs LCK and LYN among SFKs. Both nilotinib and INNO-406 were potent inhibitors of the dasatinib-resistant T315A, F317L and F317V BCR-ABL mutations.

6ab3ae6c-9bba-593f-a5d4-c5c782cf75ca	D	Identifying the determinants of response to MDM2 inhibition.	Previous reports have provided evidence that p53 mutation is a strong negative predictor of response to MDM2 inhibitors. However, this correlation is not absolute, as many p53Mutant cell lines have been reported to respond to MDM2 inhibition, while many p53WT cell lines have been shown not to respond. To better understand the nature of these exceptions, we screened a panel of 260 cell lines and noted similar discrepancies. However, upon extensive curation of this panel, these apparent exceptions could be eliminated, revealing a perfect correlation between p53 mutational status and MDM2 inhibitor responsiveness. It has been suggested that the MDM2-amplified subset of p53WT tumors might be particularly sensitive to MDM2 inhibition. To facilitate clinical testing of this hypothesis, we identified a rationally derived copy number cutoff for assignment of functionally relevant MDM2 amplification. Applying this cutoff resulted in a pan-cancer MDM2 amplification rate far lower than previously published.	D	high	The study primarily involves screening a panel of 260 cell lines to identify determinants of response to MDM2 inhibition and to establish a copy number cutoff for MDM2 amplification. This constitutes in vitro preclinical evidence, as it does not involve direct human patient data or clinical trials.

The pharmacogenetics of methotrexate (MTX) was investigated in a large cohort of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Four hundred ninety-nine children with ALL from the ALL-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster) 2000 trial who received 1996 courses of MTX at 5 g/m(2) were genotyped for 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 candidate genes of the MTX/folate pathway. Patients' MTX pharmacokinetics, MTX toxicities, and outcomes were correlated with the genotypes. The interindividual variability in MTX kinetics had a substantial genetic component between 68% and 75%. The SLCO1B1 rs4149056 variant was significantly associated with MTX kinetics. In a multiple regression model, MTX area under the concentration time curve (AUC)0-48h increased by 26% (P < .001) per SLCO1B1 rs4149056 C allele. MTX AUC0-48h was a significant predictor of overall toxic adverse events during MTX courses (R(2) = 0.043; P < .001), whereas the thymidylate synthase rs34743033 tandem repeat polymorphism was predictive of stomatitis (R(2) = 0.018; P = .009), a frequent side effect of high-dose MTX. Multiple Cox regression analyses revealed an association of minimal residual disease (hazard ratio 7.3; P < .001) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase rs1801131 (hazard ratio 3.1; P = .015) with event-free survival in the ALL-BFM 2000 study population. Genetic variations substantially influence the kinetics and response to high-dose MTX therapy in childhood ALL.

010571fe-46b5-58f6-8e0a-332b5daf17d0	D	In vitro activity of Bcr-Abl inhibitors AMN107 and BMS-354825 against clinically relevant imatinib-resistant Abl kinase domain mutants.	Imatinib, a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a highly effective therapy for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Despite durable responses in most chronic phase patients, relapses have been observed and are much more prevalent in patients with advanced disease. The most common mechanism of acquired imatinib resistance has been traced to Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations with decreased imatinib sensitivity. Thus, alternate Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors that have activity against imatinib-resistant mutants would be useful for patients who relapse on imatinib therapy. Two such Bcr-Abl inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials: the improved potency, selective Abl inhibitor AMN107 and the highly potent dual Src/Abl inhibitor BMS-354825. In the current article, we compared imatinib, AMN107, and BMS-354825 in cellular and biochemical assays against a panel of 16 kinase domain mutants representing >90% of clinical isolates. We report that AMN107 and BMS-354825 are 20-fold and 325-fold more potent than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type Bcr-Abl and that similar improvements are maintained for all imatinib-resistant mutants tested, with the exception of T315I. Thus, both inhibitors hold promise for treating imatinib-refractory CML.

5bfa4d48-759a-5126-9ea3-29bddc619e4e	D	Establishment and application of a novel patient-derived KIAA1549:BRAF-driven pediatric pilocytic astrocytoma model for preclinical drug testing.	Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most frequent pediatric brain tumor. Activation of the MAPK pathway is well established as the oncogenic driver of the disease. It is most frequently caused by KIAA1549:BRAF fusions, and leads to oncogene induced senescence (OIS). OIS is thought to be a major reason for growth arrest of PA cells in vitro and in vivo, preventing establishment of PA cultures. Hence, valid preclinical models are currently very limited, but preclinical testing of new compounds is urgently needed. We transduced the PA short-term culture DKFZ-BT66 derived from the PA of a 2-year old patient with a doxycycline-inducible system coding for Simian Vacuolating Virus 40 Large T Antigen (SV40-TAg). SV40-TAg inhibits TP53/CDKN1A and CDKN2A/RB1, two pathways critical for OIS induction and maintenance. DNA methylation array and KIAA1549:BRAF fusion analysis confirmed pilocytic astrocytoma identity of DKFZ-BT66 cells after establishment. Readouts were analyzed in proliferating as well as senescent states, including cell counts, viability, cell cycle analysis, expression of SV40-Tag, CDKN2A (p16), CDKN1A (p21), and TP53 (p53) protein, and gene-expression profiling. Selected MAPK inhibitors (MAPKi) including clinically available MEK inhibitors (MEKi) were tested in vitro. Expression of SV40-TAg enabled the cells to bypass OIS and to resume proliferation with a mean doubling time of 45h allowing for propagation and long-term culture. Withdrawal of doxycycline led to an immediate decrease of SV40-TAg expression, appearance of senescent morphology, upregulation of CDKI proteins and a subsequent G1 growth arrest in line with the re-induction of senescence. DKFZ-BT66 cells still underwent replicative senescence that was overcome by TERT expression. Testing of a set of MAPKi revealed differential responses in DKFZ-BT66. MEKi efficiently inhibited MAPK signaling at clinically achievable concentrations, while BRAF V600E- and RAF Type II inhibitors showed paradoxical activation. Taken together, we have established the first patient-derived long term expandable PA cell line expressing the KIAA1549:BRAF-fusion suitable for preclinical drug testing.

5294ea8b-c6f2-5f70-a9b4-92b70f9599c6	B	Advanced ovarian cancer: what should be the standard of care?	"The standard treatment of advanced ovarian cancer is rapidly changing. As we begin to understand that epithelial ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease, our treatment strategies are evolving to include novel biologic drugs that specifically exploit altered pathways. Surgery remains an essential component in the treatment of ovarian cancer; however, the importance of surgical specialization and defining ""optimal cytoreduction"" as no visible residual disease has been further validated. Ongoing studies are defining the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the upfront treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. In addition, clinical trials are evaluating intraperitoneal, dose dense, antiangiogenic drugs as well as targeted maintenance therapies which will establish new standards of care in the near future."

1a0a8f22-0808-5cf8-89d8-647b1bd7709c	C	Effects of KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab plus chemotherapy in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective consortium analysis.	BACKGROUND: Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. METHODS: 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. FINDINGS: 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. INTERPRETATION: While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.

60650d31-3885-5127-b6b9-b35a7ac27125	D	Structural, biochemical, and clinical characterization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations in lung cancer.	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations (G719X, exon 19 deletions/insertions, L858R, and L861Q) predict favorable responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations (~10% of all EGFR mutations) are generally associated with insensitivity to available TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib). The basis of this primary resistance is poorly understood. We studied a broad subset of exon 20 insertion mutations, comparing in vitro TKI sensitivity with responses to gefitinib and erlotinib in NSCLC patients, and found that most are resistant to EGFR TKIs. The crystal structure of a representative TKI-insensitive mutant (D770_N771insNPG) reveals an unaltered adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket, and the inserted residues form a wedge at the end of the C helix that promotes the active kinase conformation. Unlike EGFR-L858R, D770_N771insNPG activates EGFR without increasing its affinity for EGFR TKIs. Unexpectedly, we find that EGFR-A763_Y764insFQEA is highly sensitive to EGFR TKIs in vitro, and patients whose NSCLCs harbor this mutation respond to erlotinib. Analysis of the A763_Y764insFQEA mutant indicates that the inserted residues shift the register of the C helix in the N-terminal direction, altering the structure in the region that is also affected by the TKI-sensitive EGFR-L858R. Our studies reveal intricate differences between EGFR mutations, their biology, and their response to EGFR TKIs.	B	high	The abstract describes a study that includes both in vitro characterization and direct observation of patient responses to EGFR TKIs in NSCLC patients. Phrases like 'comparing in vitro TKI sensitivity with responses to gefitinib and erlotinib in NSCLC patients' and 'patients whose NSCLCs harbor this mutation respond to erlotinib' indicate the inclusion of primary patient data. While not a large-scale Phase III trial, it goes beyond preclinical models (Level D) and very small patient series (Level C) by including clinical observations in a 'broad subset' of patients, fitting the criteria for clinical evidence.
0b786ee6-0c82-5605-98ba-bb72f9f2443e	B	PTEN and PIK3CA expression is associated with prolonged survival after gefitinib treatment in EGFR-mutated lung cancer patients.	BACKGROUND: We and other researchers have previously reported that pulmonary adenocarcinomas with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are usually sensitive to gefitinib, an EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, although this relationship is not complete. In this study, we searched for mutations or changes in the expression of genes downstream to EGFR and evaluated their relationship with the effectiveness of gefitinib. METHODS: We studied 78 lung cancer patients who had recurrent disease after surgical resection and were treated with gefitinib. We searched for mutations occurring in the KRAS and PIK3CA gene. We also evaluated the expression level of EGFR, PIK3CA, and PTEN by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Gefitinib effectiveness was evaluated by imaging studies; a survival analysis was also done. RESULTS: We found seven (9%) somatic mutations in KRAS and two (2%) in PIK3CA. EGFR mutations were present in 44 (56%). KRAS mutations were found only in tumors without EGFR mutations, whereas PIK3CA mutation was found in tumors with EGFR mutation. Tumor response was assessable in 52 tumors. None of the six tumors with KRAS mutations responded to gefitinib treatment; however, two tumors with PIK3CA mutations showed partial response. Survival was significantly longer in patients with EGFR mutations or in those without KRAS mutations. In tumors with EGFR mutations, survival was longer in those with high PIK3CA or PTEN expression than in those with low expression of these molecules. CONCLUSIONS: An evaluation of the KRAS mutation, as well as PIK3CA and PTEN expression, might help identify lung cancer patients who are most suitable for gefitinib treatment.	B	high	The study involves 78 human lung cancer patients, which constitutes primary patient data with a sample size greater than 5.

f9226ecb-9d63-5904-acab-5ebf0572e1ae	B	Adjuvant Dabrafenib plus Trametinib in Stage III BRAF-Mutated Melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Combination therapy with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib plus the MEK inhibitor trametinib improved survival in patients with advanced melanoma with BRAF V600 mutations. We sought to determine whether adjuvant dabrafenib plus trametinib would improve outcomes in patients with resected, stage III melanoma with BRAF V600 mutations. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 870 patients with completely resected, stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations to receive oral dabrafenib at a dose of 150 mg twice daily plus trametinib at a dose of 2 mg once daily (combination therapy, 438 patients) or two matched placebo tablets (432 patients) for 12 months. The primary end point was relapse-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, freedom from relapse, and safety. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 2.8 years, the estimated 3-year rate of relapse-free survival was 58% in the combination-therapy group and 39% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for relapse or death, 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.58; P<0.001). The 3-year overall survival rate was 86% in the combination-therapy group and 77% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.79; P=0.0006), but this level of improvement did not cross the prespecified interim analysis boundary of P=0.000019. Rates of distant metastasis-free survival and freedom from relapse were also higher in the combination-therapy group than in the placebo group. The safety profile of dabrafenib plus trametinib was consistent with that observed with the combination in patients with metastatic melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant use of combination therapy with dabrafenib plus trametinib resulted in a significantly lower risk of recurrence in patients with stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations than the adjuvant use of placebo and was not associated with new toxic effects.

af2f1783-b6a6-5c45-a37f-1ee2391bae57	D	Characteristics of lung cancers harboring NRAS mutations.	PURPOSE: We sought to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of patients with lung cancer harboring NRAS mutations. We used preclinical models to identify targeted therapies likely to be of benefit against NRAS-mutant lung cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We reviewed clinical data from patients whose lung cancers were identified at six institutions or reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) to harbor NRAS mutations. Six NRAS-mutant cell lines were screened for sensitivity against inhibitors of multiple kinases (i.e., EGFR, ALK, MET, IGF-1R, BRAF, PI3K, and MEK). RESULTS: Among 4,562 patients with lung cancers tested, NRAS mutations were present in 30 (0.7%; 95% confidence interval, 0.45%-0.94%); 28 of these had no other driver mutations. 83% had adenocarcinoma histology with no significant differences in gender. While 95% of patients were former or current smokers, smoking-related G:C>T:A transversions were significantly less frequent in NRAS-mutated lung tumors than KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC; NRAS: 13% (4/30), KRAS: 66% (1772/2733), P < 0.00000001]. Five of 6 NRAS-mutant cell lines were sensitive to the MEK inhibitors, selumetinib and trametinib, but not to other inhibitors tested. CONCLUSION: NRAS mutations define a distinct subset of lung cancers (∼1%) with potential sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. Although NRAS mutations are more common in current/former smokers, the types of mutations are not those classically associated with smoking.	B	high	The study involves a review of clinical data from a large cohort of patients (4,562 screened, with 30 identified as harboring NRAS mutations), which constitutes 'primary patient data with >5 patients'. It includes statistical results regarding frequency and characteristics. While there is a preclinical component using cell lines, the primary evidence for human characteristics and frequency comes from the clinical data analysis.
6ab3ae6c-9bba-593f-a5d4-c5c782cf75ca	D	Identifying the determinants of response to MDM2 inhibition.	Previous reports have provided evidence that p53 mutation is a strong negative predictor of response to MDM2 inhibitors. However, this correlation is not absolute, as many p53Mutant cell lines have been reported to respond to MDM2 inhibition, while many p53WT cell lines have been shown not to respond. To better understand the nature of these exceptions, we screened a panel of 260 cell lines and noted similar discrepancies. However, upon extensive curation of this panel, these apparent exceptions could be eliminated, revealing a perfect correlation between p53 mutational status and MDM2 inhibitor responsiveness. It has been suggested that the MDM2-amplified subset of p53WT tumors might be particularly sensitive to MDM2 inhibition. To facilitate clinical testing of this hypothesis, we identified a rationally derived copy number cutoff for assignment of functionally relevant MDM2 amplification. Applying this cutoff resulted in a pan-cancer MDM2 amplification rate far lower than previously published.	D	high	The study primarily describes screening a panel of 260 cell lines to identify determinants of response to MDM2 inhibition and developing a copy number cutoff. This constitutes in vitro preclinical evidence, as it is not direct human evidence but rather uses cell line models.
a5ee76d1-96e7-5b9c-a655-0aee2ece6e5b	D	CDK4/6 inhibition is more active against the glioblastoma proneural subtype.	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal brain tumor. Gene expression profiling has classified GBM into distinct subtypes, including proneural, mesenchymal, and classical, and identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities of these subtypes is an extremely high priority. We leveraged The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, in particular for microRNA expression, to seek druggable core pathways in GBM. The E2F1-regulated miR-17˜92 cluster and its analogs are shown to be highly expressed in proneural GBM and in GSC lines, suggesting the E2F cell cycle pathway might be a key driver in proneural GBM. Consistently, CDK4/6 inhibition with palbociclib preferentially inhibited cell proliferation <i>in vitro</i> in a majority of proneural GSCs versus those of other subtypes. Palbociclib treatment significantly prolonged survival of mice with established intracranial xenografts of a proneural GSC line. We show that most of these sensitive PN GSCs expressed higher levels of CDK6 and had intact Rb1, while two GSC lines with CDK4 overexpression and null Rb1 were highly resistant to palbociclib. Importantly, palbociclib treatment of proneural GSCs upregulated mesenchymal-associated markers and downregulated proneural-associated markers, suggesting that CDK4/6 inhibition induced proneural-mesenchymal transition and underscoring the enhanced role of the E2F cell cycle pathway in the proneural subtype. Lastly, the combination of palbociclib and N,N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde, an inhibitor of the mesenchymal driver ALDH1A3, showed strong synergistic inhibitory effects against proneural GSC proliferation. Taken together, our results reveal that proneural GBM has increased vulnerability to CDK4/6 inhibition, and the proneural subtype undergoes dynamic reprogramming upon palbociclib treatment-suggesting the need for a combination therapeutic strategy.	D	high	The study primarily presents evidence from in vitro experiments using glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) lines and in vivo experiments using mouse xenograft models. This aligns with the definition of Preclinical Evidence (Level D), which involves in vivo or in vitro models and is not direct human evidence.

INTRODUCTION: MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase gene (MET) exon 14 skipping is a targetable alteration in lung cancer. Treatment with MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor can cause dramatic responses in patients whose cancers have MET exon 14 skipping. Little is known, however, about acquired resistance in patients with MET exon 14 skipping. METHODS: Biopsy specimens obtained at baseline and at the time of progression for a patient being treated with crizotinib were compared using targeted next-generation sequencing to assess for mechanisms of resistance. RESULTS: An acquired mutation in the MET kinase domain, D1228N, was found at time of progression on crizotinib in a patient with MET exon 14 skipping. CONCLUSIONS: One potential mechanism of acquired resistance to crizotinib in patients with MET exon 14 skipping is through second-site mutations in the MET gene. Understanding mechanisms of resistance will be important in optimizing therapy in these patients.	C	high	The study describes findings from a single patient, comparing biopsy specimens at baseline and progression to identify a mechanism of acquired resistance. This aligns with the definition of a case study or very small patient series (<5 patients).

BACKGROUND: About half of patients with papillary thyroid cancer have tumours with activating BRAF(V600E) mutations. Vemurafenib, an oncogenic BRAF kinase inhibitor approved for BRAF-positive melanoma, showed clinical benefit in three patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer in a phase 1 trial. We aimed to establish the activity of vemurafenib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer. METHODS: We did an open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 trial at ten academic centres and hospitals worldwide in patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic papillary thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine and positive for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Participants either had never received a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR (cohort 1) or had been treated previously with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor (cohort 2). Patients received vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed best overall response in cohort 1 (confirmed on two assessments 4 weeks or longer apart). Analyses were planned to have a minimum median follow-up of 15 months (data cutoff April 18, 2014) and were done in safety, intention-to-treat, and per-protocol populations. This trial is closed and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01286753. FINDINGS: Between June 23, 2011, and Jan 15, 2013, 51 patients were enrolled to the study, 26 in cohort 1 and 25 in cohort 2. Median duration of follow-up was 18·8 months (IQR 14·2-26·0) in cohort 1 and 12·0 months (6·7-20·3) in cohort 2. Partial responses were recorded in ten of 26 patients in cohort 1 (best overall response 38·5%, 95% CI 20·2-59·4). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were recorded in 17 (65%) of 26 patients in cohort 1 and 17 (68%) of 25 patients in cohort 2; the most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (seven [27%] in cohort 1, five [20%] in cohort 2), lymphopenia (two [8%] in each cohort), and increased γ-glutamyltransferase (one [4%] in cohort 1, three [12%] in cohort 2). Two individuals in cohort 2 died due to adverse events, one from dyspnoea and one from multiorgan failure, but neither was treatment related. Serious adverse events were reported for 16 (62%) of 26 patients in cohort 1 and 17 (68%) of 25 patients in cohort 2. INTERPRETATION: Vemurafenib showed antitumour activity in patients with progressive, BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine who had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor. As such, this agent represents a potential new treatment option for these patients. FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche.

ad0bcde3-691a-57d8-86b6-4838738fe232	B	Phase 1 study of tazemetostat in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma.	BACKGROUND: Tazemetostat is a selective and orally available inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase and epigenetic regulator of cellular differentiation programs. We carried out a phase I study of tazemetostat in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin-type lymphoma (B-NHL) to evaluate its tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity. METHODS: Tazemetostat was given orally at a single dose of 800 mg on the first day and 800 mg twice daily (BID: total 1600 mg/d) on following days in a 28-day/cycle manner. Tazemetostat dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated up to the end of the first treatment cycle. Archival tumor tissues were analyzed for hotspot EZH2 mutations. RESULTS: As of 15 January 2018, seven patients (four follicular lymphoma [FL] and three diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]) were enrolled. The median age was 73 (range, 59-85) years, and the median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was three (range, one to five). No DLT was observed (one patient was not evaluable due to early disease progression). The common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were thrombocytopenia and dysgeusia (three patients each; 42.9%). No treatment-related serious AEs were observed. The objective response rate was 57% (4/7 patients), including responses in three of four patients with FL and one of three patients with DLBCL. An EZH2 mutation was detected in one patient with FL responding to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Tazemetostat at 800 mg BID showed an acceptable safety profile and promising antitumor activity in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory B-NHL.

We compared the clinical outcomes in gefitinib- and erlotinib-treated patients harboring EGFR mutations who had recurrent or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: A total of 375 patients with recurrent or metastatic stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, who had either exon 19 deletion or the L858R mutation in exon 21, and had received either gefitinib (n = 228) or erlotinib (n = 147), were included in the study. A matched-pair case-control study design was implemented in the analysis, where 121 pairs of gefitinib-treated and erlotinib-treated patients were matched according to sex, smoking history, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and types of EGFR mutation. RESULTS: The median age of all patients was 58 years (range, 30-84), and more than half of patients had never been smokers (63.6%). Most patients had adenocarcinoma (98.3%) and good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0, 1) (90.9%). The median number of cycles of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment was 12.7 in the gefitinib group and 10.8 in the erlotinib group. Of the 242 patients, 63 (26%) received EGFR TKI as first-line therapy. The overall response rates and disease control rates in the gefitinib- or erlotinib-treated groups were 76.9% versus 74.4% (p = 0.575) and 90.1% versus 86.8%, respectively (p = 0.305). There was no statistically significant difference with regard to PFS (median, 11.7 versus 9.6; p = 0.056) between the gefitinib- and erlotinib-treated groups. For patients receiving EGFR TKI as the first-line treatment, there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in overall response rates (76.7% and 90.0%) (p = 0.431) and median PFS (11.7 versus 14.5 months) (p = 0.507). CONCLUSION: In NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutation, treatment with gefitinib and erlotinib resulted in similar effectiveness.	B	high	The study is a matched-pair case-control study involving a large cohort of 375 human patients, comparing clinical outcomes of two treatments (gefitinib and erlotinib). It presents statistical results (e.g., response rates, PFS, p-values), which aligns with the definition of Level B for clinical evidence based on primary patient data, being less definitive than a prospective Phase III trial (Level A).
9e4faf99-4d70-505e-b46b-f36d1f91ec74	B	Phase I expansion and pharmacodynamic study of the oral MEK inhibitor RO4987655 (CH4987655) in selected patients with advanced cancer with RAS-RAF mutations.	PURPOSE: This phase I expansion study assessed safety, pharmacodynamic effects, and antitumor activity of RO4987655, a pure MEK inhibitor, in selected patients with advanced solid tumor. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We undertook a multicenter phase I two-part study (dose escalation and cohort expansion). Here, we present the part 2 expansion that included melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and colorectal cancer with oral RO4987655 administered continuously at recommended doses of 8.5 mg twice daily until progressive disease (PD). Sequential tumor sampling investigated multiple markers of pathway activation/tumor effects, including ERK phosphorylation and Ki-67 expression. BRAF and KRAS testing were implemented as selection criteria and broader tumor mutational analysis added. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients received RO4987655, including 18 BRAF-mutant melanoma, 23 BRAF wild-type melanoma, 24 KRAS-mutant NSCLC, and 30 KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer. Most frequent adverse events were rash, acneiform dermatitis, and gastrointestinal disorders, mostly grade 1/2. Four (24%) of 17 BRAF-mutated melanoma had partial response as did four (20%) of 20 BRAF wild-type melanoma and two (11%) of 18 KRAS-mutant NSCLC. All KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer developed PD. Paired tumor biopsies demonstrated reduced ERK phosphorylation among all cohorts but significant differences among cohorts in Ki-67 modulation. Sixty-nine percent showed a decrease in fluorodeoxyglucose uptake between baseline and day 15. Detailed mutational profiling confirmed RAS/RAF screening and identified additional aberrations (NRAS/non-BRAF melanomas; PIK3CA/KRAS colorectal cancer) without therapeutic implications. CONCLUSIONS: Safety profile of RO4987655 was comparable with other MEK inhibitors. Single-agent activity was observed in all entities except colorectal cancer. Evidence of target modulation and early biologic activity was shown among all indications independent of mutational status. Clin Cancer Res; 20(16); 4251-61. ©2014 AACR.

7ac48eeb-ec5a-585e-bb41-7f8a4f885885	D	Gain-of-function mutations of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha gene in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have gain-of-function mutations of c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) gene, but some GISTs do not. We investigated the cause of GISTs without KIT mutations. Because GISTs apparently expressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) alpha, we examined whether GISTs without KIT mutations had a mutation of PDGFR alpha. METHODS: Whole coding region of PDGFR alpha complementary DNA (cDNA) was sequenced in GISTs with or without KIT mutations. Mutant PDGFR alpha cDNA was transfected into 293T human embryonic kidney cells, and autophosphorylation of PDGFR alpha was examined. Proliferation of Ba/F3 murine lymphoid cells stably transfected with mutant PDGFR alpha cDNA was estimated by tritium thymidine incorporation. Wild-type KIT cDNA was cotransfected with mutant PDGFR alpha cDNA, and immunoprecipitation by anti-KIT antibody was performed. Inhibitory effect of Imatinib mesylate on activated PDGFR alpha was examined. RESULTS: We found 2 types of constitutively activated mutations of PDGFR alpha, Val-561 to Asp or Asp-842 to Val, in 5 of 8 GISTs without KIT mutations but not in 10 GISTs with KIT mutations. Stable transfection of each mutation induced autonomous proliferation of Ba/F3 cells. Constitutively activated mutant PDGFR alpha bound and activated the cotransfected wild-type KIT. The constitutive activation of PDGFR alpha with Val-561 to Asp was inhibited effectively by Imatinib mesylate but that of PDGFR alpha with Asp-842 to Val was inhibited only weakly, even at the concentration of 10 micromol/L. CONCLUSIONS: The gain-of-function mutations of PDGFR alpha appear to play an important role in development of GISTs without KIT mutations.	B	high	The study involves the sequencing of PDGFR alpha in 18 human gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) samples (8 without KIT mutations and 10 with KIT mutations), identifying gain-of-function mutations in 5 of 8 GISTs without KIT mutations. This constitutes primary patient data with more than 5 patients, which aligns with the definition of Level B. While the abstract also describes in vitro experiments, the core finding regarding the association of mutations with GISTs is based on direct human clinical samples.

Talazoparib inhibits PARP catalytic activity, trapping PARP1 on damaged DNA and causing cell death in <i>BRCA1/2</i>-mutated cells. We evaluated talazoparib therapy in this two-part, phase I, first-in-human trial. Antitumor activity, MTD, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of once-daily talazoparib were determined in an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study (NCT01286987). The MTD was 1.0 mg/day, with an elimination half-life of 50 hours. Treatment-related adverse events included fatigue (26/71 patients; 37%) and anemia (25/71 patients; 35%). Grade 3 to 4 adverse events included anemia (17/71 patients; 24%) and thrombocytopenia (13/71 patients; 18%). Sustained PARP inhibition was observed at doses ≥0.60 mg/day. At 1.0 mg/day, confirmed responses were observed in 7 of 14 (50%) and 5 of 12 (42%) patients with <i>BRCA</i> mutation-associated breast and ovarian cancers, respectively, and in patients with pancreatic and small cell lung cancer. Talazoparib demonstrated single-agent antitumor activity and was well tolerated in patients at the recommended dose of 1.0 mg/day.<b>Significance:</b> In this clinical trial, we show that talazoparib has single-agent antitumor activity and a tolerable safety profile.

62f24922-0cec-54cf-8c98-fd9501b5b01f	C	Dasatinib induces significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase.	Treatment options are limited for patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-AP). Dasatinib is a novel, potent, oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC-family kinases that showed marked efficacy in a phase 1 trial of patients with imatinib-resistant CML. Results are presented for 107 patients with CML-AP with imatinib-resistance or -intolerance from a phase 2, open-label study further evaluating dasatinib efficacy and safety. At 8 months' minimum follow-up, 81%, 64%, and 39% of patients achieved overall, major (MaHR), and complete hematologic responses, respectively, whereas 33% and 24% attained major and complete cytogenetic remission. Of 69 patients who achieved MaHR, 7 progressed. Seventy-six percent of patients are estimated to be alive and progression-free at 10 months. Response rates for the 60% of patients with baseline BCR-ABL mutations did not differ from the total population. Dasatinib was well tolerated: most nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate; no imatinib-intolerant patients discontinued dasatinib because of AEs. Although common (76% of patients with severe neutropenia), cytopenias were manageable through dose modification. In summary, dasatinib induced significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance, was well tolerated, and may represent a potent new therapeutic option for CML-AP. Further follow-up is warranted. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #CA180005.	B	high	The abstract explicitly states this is a 'phase 2, open-label study' involving '107 patients' and provides 'statistical results' regarding hematologic and cytogenetic responses.

53de5793-e8b4-541b-b3c0-6c02b17fb844	E	Distribution and levels of cell surface expression of CD33 and CD123 in acute myeloid leukemia.	Owing to the more recent positive results with the anti-CD33 immunotoxin gemtuzumab ozogamicin, therapy against acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) targeting CD33 holds many promises. Here, CD33 and CD123 expression on AML blasts was studied by flow cytometry in a cohort of 319 patients with detailed information on French-American-British/World Health Organization (FAB/WHO) classification, cytogenetics and molecular aberrations. AMLs of 87.8% express CD33 and would therefore be targetable with anti-CD33 therapies. Additionally, 9.4% of AMLs express CD123 without concomitant CD33 expression. Thus, nearly all AMLs could be either targeted via CD33 or CD123. Simultaneous presence of both antigens was observed in 69.5% of patients. Most importantly, even AMLs with adverse cytogenetics express CD33 and CD123 levels comparable to those with favorable and intermediate subtypes. Some patient groups with unfavorable alterations, such as FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations, high FLT3-ITD mutant/wild-type ratios and monosomy 5 are even characterized by high expression of CD33 and CD123. In addition, blasts of patients with mutant nucleophosmin (NPM1) revealed significantly higher CD33 and CD123 expression pointing toward the possibility of minimal residual disease-guided interventions in mutated NPM1-positive AMLs. These results stimulate the development of novel concepts to redirect immune effector cells toward CD33- and CD123-expressing blasts using bi-specific antibodies or engineered T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from a large cohort of 319 patients, directly measuring CD33 and CD123 expression on AML blasts using flow cytometry. It provides statistical results regarding the distribution and levels of these markers across different patient subgroups, which aligns with the definition of Level B for 'primary patient data with >5 patients' and 'has statistical results but less definitive than Level A'.

In this case report, we describe a patient with <i>EML4-ALK</i>-rearranged stage IIIB MPM who was administered with alectinib and lorlatinib as first-line and fourth-line therapy, respectively. He had remarkable response evaluated as partial response on both regimens lasting approximately 3.5 months on each regimen. His plasma samples were collected during the treatment course and submitted for targeted sequencing to understand the molecular mechanisms of his therapeutic resistance. Sequencing analysis revealed the emergence of <i>ALK</i> I1171N and L1196M at alectinib progression. Meanwhile, <i>ALK</i> I1171N, L1196M, and G1202R mutations were identified at lorlatinib progression, wherein L1196M is confirmed to be in <i>cis</i> to G1202R. We speculate that these multiple mutations synergistically mediated his resistance to both alectinib and lorlatinib. Our report describes the detection of <i>EML4-ALK</i> rearrangement in a patient with MPM who had remarkable therapeutic response with ALK inhibitors. Moreover, our case also revealed acquired mechanisms of lorlatinib resistance mediated by multiple mutations <i>ALK</i> I1171N, L1196M, and G1202R, contributing an incremental step to our understanding of the complexity of acquired resistance mechanisms in sequential ALK inhibitor therapy. <i>The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.</i>	C	high	The publication is explicitly described as 'a case report' and details the clinical course and molecular findings for a single patient.

8d62a6c1-f2bf-5a22-888a-32daa14d8219	D	Genome-wide profiling of genetic synthetic lethality identifies CDK12 as a novel determinant of PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity.	Small-molecule inhibitors of PARP1/2, such as olaparib, have been proposed to serve as a synthetic lethal therapy for cancers that harbor BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Indeed, in clinical trials, PARP1/2 inhibitors elicit sustained antitumor responses in patients with germline BRCA gene mutations. In hypothesizing that additional genetic determinants might direct use of these drugs, we conducted a genome-wide synthetic lethal screen for candidate olaparib sensitivity genes. In support of this hypothesis, the set of identified genes included known determinants of olaparib sensitivity, such as BRCA1, RAD51, and Fanconi's anemia susceptibility genes. In addition, the set included genes implicated in established networks of DNA repair, DNA cohesion, and chromatin remodeling, none of which were known previously to confer sensitivity to PARP1/2 inhibition. Notably, integration of the list of candidate sensitivity genes with data from tumor DNA sequencing studies identified CDK12 deficiency as a clinically relevant biomarker of PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity. In models of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OVCa), CDK12 attenuation was sufficient to confer sensitivity to PARP1/2 inhibition, suppression of DNA repair via homologous recombination, and reduced expression of BRCA1. As one of only nine genes known to be significantly mutated in HGS-OVCa, CDK12 has properties that should confirm interest in its use as a biomarker, particularly in ongoing clinical trials of PARP1/2 inhibitors and other agents that trigger replication fork arrest.	D	high	The study primarily describes a genome-wide synthetic lethal screen and validates its findings 'in models' of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, which constitutes preclinical evidence (e.g., in vitro or in vivo non-human models). While it integrates with human tumor DNA sequencing data to identify a potential biomarker, the direct experimental evidence for sensitivity and mechanism is derived from these non-human systems.
d89027c3-2cf2-5c59-9586-911ee3bef747	B	EGFR expression as a predictor of survival for first-line chemotherapy plus cetuximab in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: analysis of data from the phase 3 FLEX study.	BACKGROUND: Findings from the phase 3 First-Line ErbituX in lung cancer (FLEX) study showed that the addition of cetuximab to first-line chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·871, 95% CI 0·762-0·996; p=0·044) in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To define patients benefiting most from cetuximab, we studied the association of tumour EGFR expression level with clinical outcome in FLEX study patients. METHODS: We used prospectively collected tumour EGFR expression data to generate an immunohistochemistry score for FLEX study patients on a continuous scale of 0-300. We used response data to select an outcome-based discriminatory threshold immunohistochemistry score for EGFR expression of 200. Treatment outcome was analysed in patients with low (immunohistochemistry score <200) and high (≥200) tumour EGFR expression. The primary endpoint in the FLEX study was overall survival. We analysed patients from the FLEX intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The FLEX study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00148798. FINDINGS: Tumour EGFR immunohistochemistry data were available for 1121 of 1125 (99·6%) patients from the FLEX study ITT population. High EGFR expression was scored for 345 (31%) evaluable patients and low for 776 (69%) patients. For patients in the high EGFR expression group, overall survival was longer in the chemotherapy plus cetuximab group than in the chemotherapy alone group (median 12·0 months [95% CI 10·2-15·2] vs 9·6 months [7·6-10·6]; HR 0·73, 0·58-0·93; p=0·011), with no meaningful increase in side-effects. We recorded no corresponding survival benefit for patients in the low EGFR expression group (median 9·8 months [8·9-12·2] vs 10·3 months [9·2-11·5]; HR 0·99, 0·84-1·16; p=0·88). A treatment interaction test assessing the difference in the HRs for overall survival between the EGFR expression groups suggested a predictive value for EGFR expression (p=0·044). INTERPRETATION: High EGFR expression is a tumour biomarker that can predict survival benefit from the addition of cetuximab to first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Assessment of EGFR expression could offer a personalised treatment approach in this setting. FUNDING: Merck KGaA.	A	high	This publication presents a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data from a large, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial (FLEX study). The analysis identifies a statistically significant predictive biomarker (high EGFR expression) for survival benefit from cetuximab in advanced NSCLC patients, which can lead to a personalized treatment approach. The robust nature of the data source (Phase 3 trial) and the clear statistical findings align with the definition of Level A, representing strong, practice-informing clinical evidence.

A 56-year-old man was referred to our clinic because of left lumbar pain and a left solitary renal tumor (9. 8 cm in diameter) and bilateral pulmonary metastases detected by computed tomographic scan. Pathologic diagnosis following open radical nephrectomy was papillary renal cell carcinoma, G2, pT2aN0M1. Subsequently, the patient was sequentially treated with interleukin-2 (3 months (mo), progressive disease (PD)), interferon-alpha (3 mo, PD), and oral S-1 as a clinical trial (28 mo, PD). Because of skin fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts, and spontaneous pneumothorax history, Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome was suspected during the treatment course, despite his having no family history of the disease. Subsequent genetic testing revealed a FLCN germline mutation (c. 1285dupC). He was started on molecular-targeting therapies sequentially, i.e., sorafenib (1 mo, PD), sunitinib (4 mo, PD), and everolimus (7 mo, PD). The patient died of progressive disease at 78 mo from the initial nephrectomy and 30 mo from the start of targeted agents. Loss of FLCN function has been shown to result in the upregulation of the PI3K/mTORC1 pathway in both in vitro experiments and in vivo FLCN knockout mice models. Despite its use as the sixth-line systematic treatment, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus exhibited a relatively long-term effect as compared with the previously used tyrosine kinase inhibitors and in contrast to the results in the RECORD-1 clinical trial. This finding may provide insight into the molecular mechanism of BHDassociated renal tumors.	C	high	The publication describes a single patient's case of metastatic renal cell carcinoma associated with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, detailing the diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. This fits the definition of a case report.
6ab3ae6c-9bba-593f-a5d4-c5c782cf75ca	D	Identifying the determinants of response to MDM2 inhibition.	Previous reports have provided evidence that p53 mutation is a strong negative predictor of response to MDM2 inhibitors. However, this correlation is not absolute, as many p53Mutant cell lines have been reported to respond to MDM2 inhibition, while many p53WT cell lines have been shown not to respond. To better understand the nature of these exceptions, we screened a panel of 260 cell lines and noted similar discrepancies. However, upon extensive curation of this panel, these apparent exceptions could be eliminated, revealing a perfect correlation between p53 mutational status and MDM2 inhibitor responsiveness. It has been suggested that the MDM2-amplified subset of p53WT tumors might be particularly sensitive to MDM2 inhibition. To facilitate clinical testing of this hypothesis, we identified a rationally derived copy number cutoff for assignment of functionally relevant MDM2 amplification. Applying this cutoff resulted in a pan-cancer MDM2 amplification rate far lower than previously published.	D	high	The study primarily describes screening a panel of 260 cell lines to identify determinants of response to MDM2 inhibition. This constitutes preclinical evidence using an in vitro model.
00ac98be-9a56-52ab-ac18-9cc7ff1880c6	C	High-Level Clonal FGFR Amplification and Response to FGFR Inhibition in a Translational Clinical Trial.	UNLABELLED: FGFR1 and FGFR2 are amplified in many tumor types, yet what determines response to FGFR inhibition in amplified cancers is unknown. In a translational clinical trial, we show that gastric cancers with high-level clonal FGFR2 amplification have a high response rate to the selective FGFR inhibitor AZD4547, whereas cancers with subclonal or low-level amplification did not respond. Using cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models, we show that high-level FGFR2 amplification initiates a distinct oncogene addiction phenotype, characterized by FGFR2-mediated transactivation of alternative receptor kinases, bringing PI3K/mTOR signaling under FGFR control. Signaling in low-level FGFR1-amplified cancers is more restricted to MAPK signaling, limiting sensitivity to FGFR inhibition. Finally, we show that circulating tumor DNA screening can identify high-level clonally amplified cancers. Our data provide a mechanistic understanding of the distinct pattern of oncogene addiction seen in highly amplified cancers and demonstrate the importance of clonality in predicting response to targeted therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: Robust single-agent response to FGFR inhibition is seen only in high-level FGFR-amplified cancers, with copy-number level dictating response to FGFR inhibition in vitro, in vivo, and in the clinic. High-level amplification of FGFR2 is relatively rare in gastric and breast cancers, and we show that screening for amplification in circulating tumor DNA may present a viable strategy to screen patients.

The goal of this study was to examine this phenomenon using an unbiased approach.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We utilized human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative cell lines rendered radiation-resistant (RR) via repeated exposure to radiation, a panel of HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines and three cohorts of HPV-negative HNSCC tumors (<i>n</i> = 68, 97, and 114) from patients treated with radiotherapy and subjected to genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analysis.<b>Results:</b> RR cell lines exhibited upregulation of several proteins compared with controls, including increased activation of Axl and PI3 kinase signaling as well as increased expression of PD-L1. Additionally, inhibition of either Axl or PI3 kinase led to decreased PD-L1 expression. When clinical samples were subjected to RPPA and mRNA expression analysis, PD-L1 was correlated with both Axl and PI3K signaling as well as dramatically associated with local failure following radiotherapy. This finding was confirmed examining a third cohort using immunohistochemistry. Indeed, tumors with high expression of PD-L1 had failure rates following radiotherapy of 60%, 70%, and 50% compared with 20%, 25%, and 20% in the PD-L1-low expression group (<i>P</i> = 0.01, 1.9 × 10<sup>-3</sup>, and 9 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, respectively). This finding remained significant on multivariate analysis in all groups. Additionally, patients with PD-L1 low/CD8<sup>+</sup> tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes high had no local failure or death due to disease (<i>P</i> = 5 × 10<sup>-4</sup> and <i>P</i> = 4 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, respectively).<b>Conclusions:</b> Taken together, our data point to a targetable Axl-PI3 kinase-PD-L1 axis that is highly associated with radiation resistance. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(11); 2713-22. ©2017 AACR</i>.

ace6a140-cd2c-56b1-bd3d-e068db31fa62	C	Detection of BCR-ABL mutations in patients with CML treated with imatinib is virtually always accompanied by clinical resistance, and mutations in the ATP phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) are associated with a poor prognosis.	Imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with acquired resistance commonly have detectable BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. It is unclear whether patients who remain sensitive to imatinib also have a significant incidence of mutations. We evaluated 144 patients treated with imatinib for BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing of 40 accelerated phase (AP), 64 late chronic phase (> or = 12 months from diagnosis, late-CP), and 40 early-CP patients. Mutations were detected in 27 patients at 17 different residues, 13 (33%) of 40 in AP, 14 (22%) of 64 in late-CP, and 0 of 40 in early-CP. Acquired resistance was evident in 24 (89%) of 27 patients with mutations. Twelve (92%) of 13 patients with mutations in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding loop (P-loop) died (median survival of 4.5 months after the mutation was detected). In contrast, only 3 (21%) of 14 patients with mutations outside the P-loop died (median follow-up of 11 months). As the detection of mutations was strongly associated with imatinib resistance, we analyzed features that predicted for their detection. Patients who commenced imatinib more than 4 years from diagnosis had a significantly higher incidence of mutations (18 [41%] of 44) compared with those treated within 4 years (9 [9%] of 100), P <.0001. Lack of a major cytogenetic response (MCR) was also associated with a higher likelihood of detecting a mutation; 19 (38%) of 50 patients without a MCR had mutations compared with 8 (8.5%) of 94 with an MCR, P <.0001. In conclusion, the detection of kinase domain mutations using a direct sequencing technique was almost always associated with imatinib resistance, and patients with mutations in the P-loop had a particularly poor prognosis.

d9917e6e-6c65-5fd1-b4a1-ab22b6e11c57	B	Pertuzumab plus trastuzumab for HER2-amplified metastatic colorectal cancer (MyPathway): an updated report from a multicentre, open-label, phase 2a, multiple basket study.	BACKGROUND: Therapies targeting HER2 have improved clinical outcomes in HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers, and are emerging as potential treatments for HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer. MyPathway evaluates the activity of targeted therapies in non-indicated tumour types with potentially predictive molecular alterations. We aimed to assess the activity of pertuzumab and trastuzumab in patients with HER2-amplified metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: MyPathway is an ongoing, phase 2a, multiple basket study. Patients in this subset analysis were aged 18 years or older and had treatment-refractory, histologically confirmed HER2-amplified metastatic colorectal cancer with measurable or evaluable disease and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 2 or less, enrolled from 25 hospitals or clinics in 16 states of the USA. Patients received pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, then 420 mg every 3 weeks, intravenously) and trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, intravenously). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response based on investigator-reported tumour responses. Analyses were done per protocol. This ongoing trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02091141. FINDINGS: Between Oct 20, 2014, and June 22, 2017, 57 patients with HER2-amplified metastatic colorectal cancer were enrolled in the MyPathway study and deemed eligible for inclusionin this cohort analysis. Among these 57 evaluable patients, as of Aug 1, 2017, one (2%) patient had a complete response and 17 (30%) had partial responses; thus overall 18 of 57 patients achieved an objective response (32%, 95% CI 20-45). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhoea (19 [33%] of 57 patients), fatigue (18 [32%] patients), and nausea (17 [30%] patients). Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were recorded in 21 (37%) of 57 patients, most commonly hypokalaemia and abdominal pain (each three [5%] patients). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in ten (18%) patients and two (4%) of these adverse events (ie, chills and infusion-related reaction) were considered treatment related. There were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: Dual HER2-targeted therapy with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab is well tolerated and could represent a therapeutic opportunity for patients with heavily pretreated, HER2-amplified metastatic colorectal cancer. FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech.	B	high	This is a multicentre, open-label, phase 2a clinical trial involving 57 patients.

5a5e703b-2908-50bd-8dca-3618a4fb3ff1	C	PIK3CA mutations in colorectal cancer are associated with clinical resistance to EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies.	The monoclonal antibodies (moAb) panitumumab and cetuximab target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and have proven valuable for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). EGFR-mediated signaling involves two main intracellular cascades: on one side KRAS activates BRAF, which in turn triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinases. On the other, membrane localization of the lipid kinase PIK3CA counteracts PTEN and promotes AKT1 phosphorylation, thereby activating a parallel intracellular axis. Constitutive activation of KRAS bypasses the corresponding signaling cascade and, accordingly, patients with mCRC bearing KRAS mutations are clinically resistant to therapy with panitumumab or cetuximab. We hypothesized that mutations activating PIK3CA could also preclude responsiveness to EGFR-targeted moAbs through a similar mechanism. Here, we present the mutational analysis of PIK3CA and KRAS and evaluation of the PTEN protein status in a cohort of 110 patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR moAbs. We observed 15 (13.6%) PIK3CA and 32 (29.0%) KRAS mutations. PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with clinical resistance to panitumumab or cetuximab; none of the mutated patients achieved objective response (P = 0.038). When only KRAS wild-type tumors were analyzed, the statistical correlation was stronger (P = 0.016). Patients with PIK3CA mutations displayed a worse clinical outcome also in terms of progression-free survival (P = 0.035). Our data indicate that PIK3CA mutations can independently hamper the therapeutic response to panitumumab or cetuximab in mCRC. When the molecular status of the PIK3CA/PTEN and KRAS pathways are concomitantly ascertained, up to 70% of mCRC patients unlikely to respond to EGFR moAbs can be identified.	B	high	The study analyzes primary patient data from a cohort of 110 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. It presents statistical results demonstrating a significant association between PIK3CA mutations and clinical resistance to these therapies, including objective response and progression-free survival. This fits the definition of 'Clinical Evidence' with '>5 patients' and 'statistical results but less definitive than Level A'.
b088dc30-5d4d-5c30-83a3-fbae00c9cb23	D	Heterogeneity in therapeutic response of genetically altered myeloma cell lines to interleukin 6, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, and melphalan.	Because there is no known genetic abnormality common to all patients with myeloma, it is important to understand how genetic heterogeneity may lead to differences in signal transduction, cell cycle, and response to therapy. Model cell lines have been used to study the effect that mutations in p53 and ras can have on growth properties and responses of myeloma cells. The U266 cell line has a single mutant p53 allele. Stable expression of wild-type (wt) p53 in U266 cells results in a significant suppression of interleukin (IL)-6 gene expression and in the concomitant suppression of cell growth that could be restored by the addition of exogenous IL-6. Expression of wt p53 also leads to cell cycle arrest and protection from doxorubicin (Dox)- and melphalan (Mel)-induced apoptosis. The addition of IL-6 resulted in cell cycle progression and blocked p53-mediated protection from apoptosis. ANBL6 is an IL-6-dependent cell line that is sensitive to dexamethasone (Dex), Dox, and Mel. IL-6 is able to protect ANBL6 cells from Dex- and Mel- but not Dox-induced apoptosis. To study the effect of an activating mutation in ras, the ANBL6 cell line transfected with either a constitutively activated N- or K-ras gene was used. Both N-ras12 and K-ras12 genes were able to protect ANBL6 cells from apoptosis induced by Dex, Dox, and Mel. These data show that changes in ras or p53 can alter the myeloma cell response to IL-6 and demonstrate that the genetic background can alter therapeutic responses.	D	high	The study exclusively uses myeloma cell lines (U266 and ANBL6) to investigate therapeutic responses, which falls under preclinical in vitro evidence.
beac9c19-f188-513a-a91a-9f94512d14f0	B	Open-label phase III trial of panitumumab plus best supportive care compared with best supportive care alone in patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.	PURPOSE: Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We compared the activity of panitumumab plus best supportive care (BSC) to that of BSC alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had progressed after standard chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 463 patients with 1% or more EGFR tumor cell membrane staining, measurable disease, and radiologic documentation of disease progression during or within 6 months of most recent chemotherapy to panitumumab 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus BSC (n = 231) or BSC alone (n = 232). Tumor assessments by blinded central review were scheduled from week 8 until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response, overall survival (OS), and safety. BSC patients who progressed could receive panitumumab in a cross-over study. RESULTS: Panitumumab significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.66, [P < .0001]). Median PFS time was 8 weeks (95% CI, 7.9 to 8.4) for panitumumab and 7.3 weeks (95% CI, 7.1 to 7.7) for BSC. Mean (standard error) PFS time was 13.8 (0.8) weeks for panitumumab and 8.5 (0.5) weeks for BSC. Objective response rates also favored panitumumab over BSC; after a 12-month minimum follow-up, response rates were 10% for panitumumab and 0% for BSC (P < .0001). No difference was observed in OS (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.22), which was confounded by similar activity of panitumumab after 76% of BSC patients entered the cross-over study. Panitumumab was well tolerated. Skin toxicities, hypomagnesaemia, and diarrhea were the most common toxicities observed. No patients had grade 3/4 infusion reactions. CONCLUSION: Panitumumab significantly improved PFS with manageable toxicity in patients with chemorefractory colorectal cancer.

9c02d56e-af50-565e-8dc7-387ade676489	D	Phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PIK3CA) E545K mutation confers cisplatin resistance and a migratory phenotype in cervical cancer cells.	The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is activated in many human cancers. Previously, we reported that patients with early stage cervical cancer whose tumours harbour PIK3CA exon 9 or 20 mutations have worse overall survival in response to treatment with radiation and cisplatin than patients with wild-type PIK3CA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether PIK3CA-E545K mutation renders cervical cancer cells more resistant to cisplatin and/or radiation, and whether PI3K inhibition reverses the phenotype. We found that CaSki cells that are heterozygous for the PIK3CA-E545K mutation are more resistant to cisplatin or cisplatin plus radiation than either HeLa or SiHa cells that express only wild-type PIK3CA. Similarly, HeLa cells engineered to stably express PIK3CA-E545K were more resistant to cisplatin or cisplatin plus radiation than cells expressing only wild-type PIK3CA or with PIK3CA depleted. Cells expressing the PIK3CA-E545K mutation also had constitutive PI3K pathway activation and increased cellular migration and each of these phenotypes was reversed by treatment with the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941/Pictilisib. Our results suggests that cervical cancer patients whose tumours are positive for the PIK3CA-E545K mutation may benefit from PI3K inhibitor therapy in concert with standard cisplatin and radiation therapy.	D	high	The study primarily uses in vitro models, specifically cervical cancer cell lines (CaSki, HeLa, SiHa), to investigate the effects of PIK3CA-E545K mutation on cisplatin resistance and migration, and the reversal of these phenotypes by a PI3K inhibitor. This aligns with the definition of Preclinical Evidence.

Purpose Detection of specific molecular alterations in tumors guides the selection of effective targeted treatment of patients with several types of cancer. These molecular alterations may occur in other tumor types for which the efficacy of targeted therapy remains unclear. The MyPathway study evaluates the efficacy and safety of selected targeted therapies in tumor types that harbor relevant genetic alterations but are outside of current labeling for these treatments. Methods MyPathway ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02091141) is a multicenter, nonrandomized, phase IIa multiple basket study. Patients with advanced refractory solid tumors harboring molecular alterations in human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1, or the Hedgehog pathway are treated with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively. The primary end point is investigator-assessed objective response rate within each tumor-pathway cohort. Results Between April 1, 2014 and November 1, 2016, 251 patients with 35 different tumor types received study treatment. The efficacy population contains 230 treated patients who were evaluated for response or discontinued treatment before evaluation. Fifty-two patients (23%) with 14 different tumor types had objective responses (complete, n = 4; partial, n = 48). Tumor-pathway cohorts with notable objective response rates included human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-amplified/overexpressing colorectal (38% [14 of 37]; 95% CI, 23% to 55%) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 V600-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (43% [six of 14]; 95% CI, 18% to 71%). Conclusion The four currently approved targeted therapy regimens in the MyPathway study produced meaningful responses when administered without chemotherapy in several refractory solid tumor types not currently labeled for these agents.

3f738dd0-3ae3-5d74-81da-dda9a0cb6c6b	C	RAS mutations in cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors.	BACKGROUND: Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas are common findings in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. METHODS: We performed a molecular analysis to identify oncogenic mutations (HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, CDKN2A, and TP53) in the lesions from patients treated with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. An analysis of an independent validation set and functional studies with BRAF inhibitors in the presence of the prevalent RAS mutation was also performed. RESULTS: Among 21 tumor samples, 13 had RAS mutations (12 in HRAS). In a validation set of 14 samples, 8 had RAS mutations (4 in HRAS). Thus, 60% (21 of 35) of the specimens harbored RAS mutations, the most prevalent being HRAS Q61L. Increased proliferation of HRAS Q61L-mutant cell lines exposed to vemurafenib was associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-pathway signaling and activation of ERK-mediated transcription. In a mouse model of HRAS Q61L-mediated skin carcinogenesis, the vemurafenib analogue PLX4720 was not an initiator or a promoter of carcinogenesis but accelerated growth of the lesions harboring HRAS mutations, and this growth was blocked by concomitant treatment with a MEK inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in RAS, particularly HRAS, are frequent in cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas that develop in patients treated with vemurafenib. The molecular mechanism is consistent with the paradoxical activation of MAPK signaling and leads to accelerated growth of these lesions.

We compared the growth-inhibitory effects and inhibition profile of the SRC family kinases (SFKs) of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and INNO-406. Dasatinib exhibited the strongest potency against BCR-ABL with little selectivity over SFKs. Nilotinib exhibited a weaker affinity than the other inhibitors, but was highly specific for ABL and may be useful for the treatment of P-glycoprotein overexpressing leukemic cells. INNO-406 had an intermediate affinity for BCR-ABL between that of dasatinib and nilotinib, and inhibited only SFKs LCK and LYN among SFKs. Both nilotinib and INNO-406 were potent inhibitors of the dasatinib-resistant T315A, F317L and F317V BCR-ABL mutations.

af1978ed-d205-5e6a-9cbf-17facffb25a7	D	EML4-ALK fusion gene and efficacy of an ALK kinase inhibitor in lung cancer.	PURPOSE: The EML4-ALK fusion gene has been detected in approximately 7% of Japanese non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). We determined the frequency of EML4-ALK in Caucasian NSCLC and in NSCLC cell lines. We also determined whether TAE684, a specific ALK kinase inhibitor, would inhibit the growth of EML4-ALK-containing cell lines in vitro and in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We screened 305 primary NSCLC [both U.S. (n = 138) and Korean (n = 167) patients] and 83 NSCLC cell lines using reverse transcription-PCR and by exon array analyses. We evaluated the efficacy of TAE684 against NSCLC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We detected four different variants, including two novel variants, of EML4-ALK using reverse transcription-PCR in 8 of 305 tumors (3%) and 3 of 83 (3.6%) NSCLC cell lines. All EML4-ALK-containing tumors and cell lines were adenocarcinomas. EML4-ALK was detected more frequently in NSCLC patients who were never or light (<10 pack-years) cigarette smokers compared with current/former smokers (6% versus 1%; P = 0.049). TAE684 inhibited the growth of one of three (H3122) EML4-ALK-containing cell lines in vitro and in vivo, inhibited Akt phosphorylation, and caused apoptosis. In another EML4-ALK cell line, DFCI032, TAE684 was ineffective due to coactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor and ERBB2. The combination of TAE684 and CL-387,785 (epidermal growth factor receptor/ERBB2 kinase inhibitor) inhibited growth and Akt phosphorylation and led to apoptosis in the DFCI032 cell line. CONCLUSIONS: EML4-ALK is found in the minority of NSCLC. ALK kinase inhibitors alone or in combination may nevertheless be clinically effective treatments for NSCLC patients whose tumors contain EML4-ALK.	B	high	The study includes primary patient data from 305 NSCLC tumors (U.S. and Korean patients) to determine the frequency of the EML4-ALK fusion gene and its association with smoking status, providing statistical results (P = 0.049). This falls under 'primary patient data with >5 patients' and 'has statistical results' as per the definition of Level B. While a significant portion of the study involves preclinical in vitro and in vivo cell line experiments (Level D), the substantial human patient cohort and statistical findings elevate the overall evidence level to B.
938c1199-4e5b-581e-a8b8-e15565e1ad9a	D	Early Adaptation and Acquired Resistance to CDK4/6 Inhibition in Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer.	Small-molecule inhibitors of the CDK4/6 cell-cycle kinases have shown clinical efficacy in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive metastatic breast cancer, although their cytostatic effects are limited by primary and acquired resistance. Here we report that ER-positive breast cancer cells can adapt quickly to CDK4/6 inhibition and evade cytostasis, in part, via noncanonical cyclin D1-CDK2-mediated S-phase entry. This adaptation was prevented by cotreatment with hormone therapies or PI3K inhibitors, which reduced the levels of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and other G1-S cyclins, abolished pRb phosphorylation, and inhibited activation of S-phase transcriptional programs. Combined targeting of both CDK4/6 and PI3K triggered cancer cell apoptosis in vitro and in patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models, resulting in tumor regression and improved disease control. Furthermore, a triple combination of endocrine therapy, CDK4/6, and PI3K inhibition was more effective than paired combinations, provoking rapid tumor regressions in a PDX model. Mechanistic investigations showed that acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition resulted from bypass of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 dependency through selection of CCNE1 amplification or RB1 loss. Notably, although PI3K inhibitors could prevent resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors, they failed to resensitize cells once resistance had been acquired. However, we found that cells acquiring resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors due to CCNE1 amplification could be resensitized by targeting CDK2. Overall, our results illustrate convergent mechanisms of early adaptation and acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors that enable alternate means of S-phase entry, highlighting strategies to prevent the acquisition of therapeutic resistance to these agents.

BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with the <i>BRAF</i> V600E mutation have a poor prognosis, with a median overall survival of 4 to 6 months after failure of initial therapy. Inhibition of BRAF alone has limited activity because of pathway reactivation through epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we enrolled 665 patients with <i>BRAF</i> V600E-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer who had had disease progression after one or two previous regimens. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab (triplet-therapy group); encorafenib and cetuximab (doublet-therapy group); or the investigators' choice of either cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab and FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan) (control group). The primary end points were overall survival and objective response rate in the triplet-therapy group as compared with the control group. A secondary end point was overall survival in the doublet-therapy group as compared with the control group. We report here the results of a prespecified interim analysis. RESULTS: The median overall survival was 9.0 months in the triplet-therapy group and 5.4 months in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.70; P<0.001). The confirmed response rate was 26% (95% CI, 18 to 35) in the triplet-therapy group and 2% (95% CI, 0 to 7) in the control group (P<0.001). The median overall survival in the doublet-therapy group was 8.4 months (hazard ratio for death vs. control, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.79; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 58% of patients in the triplet-therapy group, in 50% in the doublet-therapy group, and in 61% in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of encorafenib, cetuximab, and binimetinib resulted in significantly longer overall survival and a higher response rate than standard therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with the <i>BRAF</i> V600E mutation.

9cc06e2e-6ba3-52ba-a658-b4c508f7b7d1	B	Clinical Translation and Validation of a Predictive Biomarker for Patritumab, an Anti-human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 3 (HER3) Monoclonal Antibody, in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.	"BACKGROUND: During early clinical development, prospective identification of a predictive biomarker and validation of an assay method may not always be feasible. Dichotomizing a continuous biomarker measure to classify responders also leads to challenges. We present a case study of a prospective-retrospective approach for a continuous biomarker identified after patient enrollment but defined prospectively before the unblinding of data. An analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and the challenges encountered in its practical application are also provided. METHODS: HERALD (NCT02134015) was a double-blind, phase 2 study in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) randomized to erlotinib with placebo or with high or low doses of patritumab, a monoclonal antibody targeted against human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3). While the primary objective was to assess safety and progression-free survival (PFS), a secondary objective was to determine a single predictive biomarker hypothesis to identify subjects most likely to benefit from the addition of patritumab. Although not identified as the primary biomarker in the study protocol, on the basis of preclinical results from 2 independent laboratories, expression levels of the HER3 ligand heregulin (HRG) were prospectively declared the predictive biomarker before data unblinding but after subject enrollment. An assay to measure HRG mRNA was developed and validated. Other biomarkers, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status, were also evaluated in an exploratory fashion. The cutoff value for high vs. low HRG mRNA levels was set at the median delta threshold cycle. A maximum likelihood analysis was performed to evaluate the provisional cutoff. The relationship of HRG values to PFS hazard ratios (HRs) was assessed as a measure of internal validation. Additional NSCLC samples were analyzed to characterize HRG mRNA distribution. RESULTS: The subgroup of patients with high HRG mRNA levels (""HRG-high"") demonstrated clinical benefit from patritumab treatment with HRs of 0.37 (P = 0.0283) and 0.29 (P = 0.0027) in the high- and low-dose patritumab arms, respectively. However, only 102 of the 215 randomized patients (47.4%) had sufficient tumor samples for HRG mRNA measurement. Maximum likelihood analysis showed that the provisional cutoff was within the optimal range. In the placebo arm, the HRG-high subgroup demonstrated worse prognosis compared with HRG-low. A continuous relationship was observed between increased HRG mRNA levels and lower HR. Additional NSCLC samples (N = 300) demonstrated a similar unimodal distribution to that observed in this study, suggesting that the defined cutoff may be applicable to future NSCLC studies. CONCLUSIONS: The prospective-retrospective approach was successful in clinically validating a probable predictive biomarker. Post hoc in vitro studies and statistical analyses permitted further testing of the underlying assumptions. However, limitations of this analysis include the incomplete collection of adequate tumor tissue and a lack of stratification. In a phase 3 study, findings are being confirmed, and the HRG cutoff value is being further refined. CLINICALTRIALSGOV NUMBER: NCT02134015."

3f49b91f-edc0-58d9-9063-f27483f7da63	C	Dasatinib in imatinib-resistant Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias.	BACKGROUND: The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is effective in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) leukemias, but relapse occurs, mainly as a result of the outgrowth of leukemic subclones with imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations. We evaluated dasatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor that targets most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Patients with various phases of CML or with Ph-positive ALL who could not tolerate or were resistant to imatinib were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation study. Dasatinib (15 to 240 mg per day) was administered orally in four-week treatment cycles, once or twice daily. RESULTS: A complete hematologic response was achieved in 37 of 40 patients with chronic-phase CML, and major hematologic responses were seen in 31 of 44 patients with accelerated-phase CML, CML with blast crisis, or Ph-positive ALL. In these two phases, the rates of major cytogenetic response were 45 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Responses were maintained in 95 percent of patients with chronic-phase disease and in 82 percent of patients with accelerated-phase disease, with a median follow-up more than 12 months and 5 months, respectively. Nearly all patients with lymphoid blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL had a relapse within six months. Responses occurred among all BCR-ABL genotypes, with the exception of the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to both dasatinib and imatinib in vitro. Myelosuppression was common but not dose-limiting. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib induces hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with CML or Ph-positive ALL who cannot tolerate or are resistant to imatinib.

The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway drives a subset of medulloblastomas, a malignant neuroectodermal brain cancer, and other cancers. Small-molecule Shh pathway inhibitors have induced tumor regression in mice and patients with medulloblastoma; however, drug resistance rapidly emerges, in some cases via de novo mutation of the drug target. Here we assess the response and resistance mechanisms to the natural product derivative saridegib in an aggressive Shh-driven mouse medulloblastoma model. In this model, saridegib treatment induced tumor reduction and significantly prolonged survival. Furthermore, the effect of saridegib on tumor-initiating capacity was demonstrated by reduced tumor incidence, slower growth, and spontaneous tumor regression that occurred in allografts generated from previously treated autochthonous medulloblastomas compared with those from untreated donors. Saridegib, a known P-glycoprotein (Pgp) substrate, induced Pgp activity in treated tumors, which likely contributed to emergence of drug resistance. Unlike other Smoothened (Smo) inhibitors, the drug resistance was neither mutation-dependent nor Gli2 amplification-dependent, and saridegib was found to be active in cells with the D473H point mutation that rendered them resistant to another Smo inhibitor, GDC-0449. The fivefold increase in lifespan in mice treated with saridegib as a single agent compares favorably with both targeted and cytotoxic therapies. The absence of genetic mutations that confer resistance distinguishes saridegib from other Smo inhibitors.

This aligns with the definition of Preclinical Evidence, which involves in vivo models and is not direct human evidence.
ace6a140-cd2c-56b1-bd3d-e068db31fa62	C	Detection of BCR-ABL mutations in patients with CML treated with imatinib is virtually always accompanied by clinical resistance, and mutations in the ATP phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) are associated with a poor prognosis.	Imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with acquired resistance commonly have detectable BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. It is unclear whether patients who remain sensitive to imatinib also have a significant incidence of mutations. We evaluated 144 patients treated with imatinib for BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing of 40 accelerated phase (AP), 64 late chronic phase (> or = 12 months from diagnosis, late-CP), and 40 early-CP patients. Mutations were detected in 27 patients at 17 different residues, 13 (33%) of 40 in AP, 14 (22%) of 64 in late-CP, and 0 of 40 in early-CP. Acquired resistance was evident in 24 (89%) of 27 patients with mutations. Twelve (92%) of 13 patients with mutations in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding loop (P-loop) died (median survival of 4.5 months after the mutation was detected). In contrast, only 3 (21%) of 14 patients with mutations outside the P-loop died (median follow-up of 11 months). As the detection of mutations was strongly associated with imatinib resistance, we analyzed features that predicted for their detection. Patients who commenced imatinib more than 4 years from diagnosis had a significantly higher incidence of mutations (18 [41%] of 44) compared with those treated within 4 years (9 [9%] of 100), P <.0001. Lack of a major cytogenetic response (MCR) was also associated with a higher likelihood of detecting a mutation; 19 (38%) of 50 patients without a MCR had mutations compared with 8 (8.5%) of 94 with an MCR, P <.0001. In conclusion, the detection of kinase domain mutations using a direct sequencing technique was almost always associated with imatinib resistance, and patients with mutations in the P-loop had a particularly poor prognosis.	B	high	This study involves primary patient data from 144 human patients, which is significantly more than 5. It presents statistical results regarding the incidence of mutations, their association with imatinib resistance, and patient prognosis, including p-values. This aligns with the definition of Level B, which includes clinical trials or primary patient data with statistical results but is less definitive than Level A.
4be9be61-f53c-50b1-9a6b-b483e50b58e8	B	Aurora-A contributes to cisplatin resistance and lymphatic metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer and predicts poor prognosis.	BACKGROUND: Platinum-based chemotherapy improves survival among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the efficiency is limited due to resistance. In this study, we aimed to identify the expression of Aurora-A and its correlation with cisplatin resistance and prognosis in NSCLC. METHODS: We used immunohistochemical analysis to determine the expression of Aurora-A protein in 102 NSCLC patients treated by surgery and adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The prognostic significances were assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox models. The potential role of Aurora-A in the regulation of cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells was examined by transfections using expression vector and small interfering RNA or using small-molecule inhibitors. RESULTS: Aurora-A expression was significantly associated with clinical stage (p = 0.018), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.038) and recurrence (p = 0.005), and was an independent prognostic parameter in multivariate analysis. High level of Aurora-A expression predicted poorer overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). In vitro data showed that Aurora-A expression was elevated in cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells, and overexpression or knockdown of Aurora-A resulted in increased or decreased cellular resistance to cisplatin. Furthermore, inhibition of Aurora-A reversed the migration ability of cisplatin-resistant cells. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest that high Aurora-A expression is correlated with cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic resistance and predicts poor patient survival in NSCLC. Aurora-A might serve as a predictive biomarker of drug response and therapeutic target to reverse chemotherapy resistance.	B	high	The study includes primary patient data from 102 NSCLC patients, analyzing Aurora-A expression and its correlation with cisplatin resistance and prognosis using statistical methods (Kaplan-Meier, Cox models). This fits the definition of Level B for 'Clinical Evidence' as it involves primary patient data with more than 5 patients and statistical results. While the study also includes in vitro experiments (Level D), the human patient data represents the highest level of evidence presented.

9479caae-a6b7-5723-8c7d-ea3ca6906510	C	Resensitization to Crizotinib by the Lorlatinib ALK Resistance Mutation L1198F.	In a patient who had metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged lung cancer, resistance to crizotinib developed because of a mutation in the ALK kinase domain. This mutation is predicted to result in a substitution of cysteine by tyrosine at amino acid residue 1156 (C1156Y). Her tumor did not respond to a second-generation ALK inhibitor, but it did respond to lorlatinib (PF-06463922), a third-generation inhibitor. When her tumor relapsed, sequencing of the resistant tumor revealed an ALK L1198F mutation in addition to the C1156Y mutation. The L1198F substitution confers resistance to lorlatinib through steric interference with drug binding. However, L1198F paradoxically enhances binding to crizotinib, negating the effect of C1156Y and resensitizing resistant cancers to crizotinib. The patient received crizotinib again, and her cancer-related symptoms and liver failure resolved. (Funded by Pfizer and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01970865.).	C	high	The abstract describes a single patient case where resistance to crizotinib developed, followed by treatment with lorlatinib, and then resensitization to crizotinib due to a new mutation. This falls under the definition of a 'Case Study' or 'very small patient series (<5 patients)'.
1a0a8f22-0808-5cf8-89d8-647b1bd7709c	B	Effects of KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab plus chemotherapy in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective consortium analysis.	BACKGROUND: Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. METHODS: 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. FINDINGS: 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. INTERPRETATION: While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.

fa341405-aca2-5b10-9013-a71a7bdfd945	D	Toll-like receptor 9 agonist IMO cooperates with cetuximab in K-ras mutant colorectal and pancreatic cancers.	PURPOSE: K-Ras somatic mutations are a strong predictive biomarker for resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer. We previously showed that the novel Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist immunomodulatory oligonucleotide (IMO) has a strong in vivo activity in colorectal cancer models by interfering with EGFR-related signaling and synergizing with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In the present study, we investigated, both in vitro and in vivo, the antitumor effect of IMO alone or in combination with cetuximab in subcutaneous colon and orthotopic pancreatic cancer models harboring K-Ras mutations and resistance to EGFR inhibitors. RESULTS: We showed that IMO was able to significantly restore the sensitivity of K-Ras mutant cancer cells to cetuximab, producing a marked inhibition of cell survival and a complete suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, when used in combination with cetuximab. IMO interfered with EGFR-dependent signaling, modulating the functional interaction between TLR9 and EGFR. In vivo, IMO plus cetuximab combination caused a potent and long-lasting cooperative antitumor activity in LS174T colorectal cancer and in orthotopic AsPC1 pancreatic cancer. The capability of IMO to restore cetuximab sensitivity was further confirmed by using K-Ras mutant colorectal cancer cell models obtained through homologous recombination technology. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that IMO markedly inhibits growth of K-Ras mutant colon and pancreatic cancers in vitro and in nude mice and cooperates with cetuximab via multiple mechanisms of action. Therefore, we propose IMO plus cetuximab as a therapeutic strategy for K-Ras wild-type as well for K-Ras mutant, cetuximab-resistant colorectal and pancreatic cancers.	D	high	The study explicitly states that it investigated the antitumor effect 'both in vitro and in vivo' using 'subcutaneous colon and orthotopic pancreatic cancer models' and 'nude mice'. This aligns with the definition of Preclinical Evidence, which involves in vivo or in vitro models and is not direct human evidence.
2d57d9d0-ea4e-58b3-97b5-6e9c655a20fc	A	BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia: a review.	Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a clonal disease characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph+) chromosome and its oncogenic product, BCR-ABL, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, that is present in >90% of the patients. Epidemiologic data indicates that almost 5000 new cases are reported every year and 10% of these patients eventually succumb to the disease. The treatment of CML was revolutionized by the introduction of imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec), a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The clinical use of specific BCR-ABL inhibitors has resulted in a significantly improved prognosis, response rate, overall survival, and patient outcome in CML patients compared to previous therapeutic regimens. However, the complete eradication of CML in patients receiving imatinib was limited by the emergence of resistance mostly due to mutations in the ABL kinase domain and to a lesser extent by molecular residual disease after treatment. The second-generation BCR-ABL TKIs nilotinib (Tasigna) and dasatinib (Sprycel), showed significant activity in clinical trials in patients intolerant or resistant to imatinib therapy, except in those patients with the T315I BCR-ABL mutation. Identifying key components involved in the CML pathogenesis may lead to the exploration of new approaches that might eventually overcome resistance mediated to the BCR-ABL TKIs. Here, we present an overview about the current treatment of Ph+ CML patients with the TKIs and the obstacles to successful treatment with these drugs.	A	high	The publication is a review article that synthesizes and discusses the established clinical efficacy and outcomes of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors in CML. It references clinical trials and their significant impact on patient prognosis and survival, indicating a 'proven/consensus association in human medicine' which aligns with Level A evidence.
a1f8ea6e-7df8-5485-b0d7-c220a1e0bef3	D	PTEN activation contributes to tumor inhibition by trastuzumab, and loss of PTEN predicts trastuzumab resistance in patients.	The ErbB2-targeting antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin), has remarkable therapeutic efficacy in certain patients with ErbB2-overexpressing tumors. The overall trastuzumab response rate, however, is limited and what determines trastuzumab response is poorly understood. Here we report that PTEN activation contributes to trastuzumab's antitumor activity. Trastuzumab treatment quickly increased PTEN membrane localization and phosphatase activity by reducing PTEN tyrosine phosphorylation via Src inhibition. Reducing PTEN in breast cancer cells by antisense oligonucleotides conferred trastuzumab resistance in vitro and in vivo. Patients with PTEN-deficient breast cancers had significantly poorer responses to trastuzumab-based therapy than those with normal PTEN. Thus, PTEN deficiency is a powerful predictor for trastuzumab resistance. Additionally, PI3K inhibitors rescued PTEN loss-induced trastuzumab resistance, suggesting that PI3K-targeting therapies could overcome this resistance.	B	high	The abstract describes analysis of primary patient data, stating that 'Patients with PTEN-deficient breast cancers had significantly poorer responses to trastuzumab-based therapy than those with normal PTEN.' This indicates clinical evidence with statistical results, aligning with Level B. While the study also includes preclinical in vitro and in vivo data, the patient data elevates the evidence beyond Level D.
bf55e6dd-cd30-57fc-a178-36a906ae7e92	D	Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 is an ideal target for ovary tumors with elevated cyclin E1 expression.	CCNE1 gene amplification is present in 15-20% ovary tumor specimens. Here, we showed that Cyclin E1 (CCNE1) was overexpressed in 30% of established ovarian cancer cell lines. We also showed that CCNE1 was stained positive in over 40% of primary ovary tumor specimens regardless of their histological types while CCNE1 staining was either negative or low in normal ovary and benign ovary tumor tissues. However, the status of CCNE1 overexpression was not associated with the tumorigenic potential of ovarian cancer cell lines and also did not correlate with pathological grades of ovary tumor specimens. Subsequent experiments with CCNE1 siRNAs showed that knockdown of CCNE1 reduced cell growth only in cells with inherent CCNE1 overexpression, indicating that these cells may have developed an addiction to CCNE1 for growth/survival. As CCNE1 is a regulatory factor of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2), we investigated the effect of Cdk2 inhibitor on ovary tumorigenecity. Ovarian cancer cells with elevated CCNE1 expression were 40 times more sensitive to Cdk2 inhibitorSNS-032 than those without inherent CCNE1 overexpression. Moreover, SNS-032 greatly prolonged the survival of mice bearing ovary tumors with inherent CCNE1 overexpression. This study suggests that ovary tumors with elevated CCNE1 expression may be staged for Cdk2-targeted therapy.	D	high	The study primarily presents findings from in vitro experiments using ovarian cancer cell lines and in vivo experiments using mice models. While it mentions analysis of primary human tumor specimens, these are for observational staining and correlation, not for an intervention study or clinical trial. The core findings regarding the Cdk2 inhibitor's efficacy are derived from preclinical models (cell lines and mice), which aligns with Level D.
c530e795-3840-57d4-b1f4-89f2143ab4bc	C	EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and response to osimertinib in non-small-cell lung cancer.	BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor exon 20 insertion (EGFRex20ins) mutations represent approximately 4-12% of EGFR mutations and are generally refractory to the 1st and 2nd generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Development of effective therapies for patients with EGFRex20ins mutant non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) represents a great unmet need. Preclinical models have shown that osimertinib is active in NSCLC harboring EGFRex20ins, while the antitumor activity of osimertinib remains to be evaluated in patients with EGFRex20ins mutations. METHODS: Tumor genotyping was performed in 2316 Chinese NSCLC cases with targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) covering the whole exons of EGFR gene. The frequency and genetic characteristics of EGFRexon20ins mutations were analyzed. Furthermore, six patients with specific EGFRexon20ins mutations and receiving osimertinib 80 mg once daily were retrospectively included to assess the antitumor activity and safety of monotherapy osimertinib. RESULTS: EGFRex20ins mutations were identified in 4.8% (53/1095) of EGFR mutant NSCLC and 2.3% (53/2316) of all NSCLC cases. The most frequently identified EGFRexon20ins is A767_V769dup (17/53,32.1%). We found that the genetic characteristics of EGFRex20ins mutations in Chinese patients with NSCLC were comparable to those reported in Caucasian patients. Four patients with osimertinib therapy achieved partial response and the rest stable disease. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 6.2 months (95% confidence interval 5.0-12.9 months; range 4.9-14.6 months). The most common adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (2/6), pruritis (2/6), stomatitis (1/6) and nausea (1/6). No grade 3 or more AEs were documented. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that the genetic characteristics of EGFRex20ins mutations in Chinese patients with NSCLC were comparable to those reported in Caucasian patients. Furthermore, our study firstly demonstrated promising antitumor activity of osimertinib in certain EGFRex20ins mutant advanced NSCLC patients, indicating that osimertinib treatment for EGFRex20ins positive patients deserves further study.	B	high	The study retrospectively included six patients with specific EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations who received osimertinib. It reports clinical outcomes such as partial response, stable disease, and median progression-free survival. This constitutes primary patient data with more than five patients, aligning with the definition of Level B clinical evidence.
8e01ff28-8350-5c0f-b1f6-5e15418e05c9	C	Molecular Changes Associated with Acquired Resistance to Crizotinib in ROS1-Rearranged Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	PURPOSE: Although ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is sensitive to crizotinib, development of resistance is inevitable. Here, we identified molecular alterations in crizotinib-resistant tumors from two NSCLC patients with the CD74-ROS1 rearrangement, and in HCC78 cells harboring SLC34A2-ROS1 that showed resistance to crizotinib (HCC78CR cells). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ROS1 kinase domain mutations were examined in fresh tumor tissues from two NSCLC patients and HCC78CR1-3 cells by direct sequencing. Ba/F3 cells expressing ROS1 secondary mutations were constructed to evaluate resistance to crizotinib. An upregulated pathway was identified using phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array, EGFR signaling antibody array, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Cell proliferation and ROS1 downstream signaling pathways were compared between HCC78 and HCC78CR1-3 cells. RESULTS: The ROS1 G2032R mutation was identified in crizotinib-resistant tumors from one patient. Furthermore, HCC78CR1 and CR2 cells harbored a novel ROS1 L2155S mutation (73.3% and 76.2%, respectively). ROS1 G2032R and L2155S mutations conferred resistance to crizotinib in Ba/F3 cells. Evidence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition with downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was observed in HCC78CR1-2 cells and in the other patient. RNA-seq and EGFR signaling antibody array revealed that the EGFR pathway was significantly upregulated in HCC78CR3 versus HCC78 cells. Cells with the ROS1 mutation and upregulated EGFR were sensitive to foretinib, an inhibitor of c-MET, VEGFR2, and ROS1 and irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors plus crizotinib, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular changes associated with acquired crizotinib resistance in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC are heterogeneous, including ROS1 tyrosine kinase mutations, EGFR activation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.	C	high	The study includes direct human evidence from two NSCLC patients, which falls under the definition of a 'very small patient series' (<5 patients), characteristic of a Level C case study. While it also incorporates extensive preclinical (in vitro cell line) data, the presence of direct patient data, even if limited, elevates it beyond purely preclinical evidence.
80adfe71-5c9b-543f-aebf-d3cda8c5d488	C	Comprehensive genomic analysis reveals FLT3 activation and a therapeutic strategy for a patient with relapsed adult B-lymphoblastic leukemia.	The genomic events responsible for the pathogenesis of relapsed adult B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are not yet clear. We performed integrative analysis of whole-genome, whole-exome, custom capture, whole-transcriptome (RNA-seq), and locus-specific genomic assays across nine time points from a patient with primary de novo B-ALL. Comprehensive genome and transcriptome characterization revealed a dramatic tumor evolution during progression, yielding a tumor with complex clonal architecture at second relapse. We observed and validated point mutations in EP300 and NF1, a highly expressed EP300-ZNF384 gene fusion, a microdeletion in IKZF1, a focal deletion affecting SETD2, and large deletions affecting RB1, PAX5, NF1, and ETV6. Although the genome analysis revealed events of potential biological relevance, no clinically actionable treatment options were evident at the time of the second relapse. However, transcriptome analysis identified aberrant overexpression of the targetable protein kinase encoded by the FLT3 gene. Although the patient had refractory disease after salvage therapy for the second relapse, treatment with the FLT3 inhibitor sunitinib rapidly induced a near complete molecular response, permitting the patient to proceed to a matched-unrelated donor stem cell transplantation. The patient remains in complete remission more than 4 years later. Analysis of this patient's relapse genome revealed an unexpected, actionable therapeutic target that led to a specific therapy associated with a rapid clinical response. For some patients with relapsed or refractory cancers, this approach may indicate a novel therapeutic intervention that could alter outcome.	C	high	The study describes a comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis and subsequent therapeutic intervention for a single patient with relapsed adult B-lymphoblastic leukemia. This aligns with the definition of a case study or very small patient series (<5 patients).

BACKGROUND: Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. METHODS: 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. FINDINGS: 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. INTERPRETATION: While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.

While not a prospective randomized controlled trial (which would typically be Level A), it provides strong clinical evidence from a large human cohort.
1a0a8f22-0808-5cf8-89d8-647b1bd7709c	B	Effects of KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab plus chemotherapy in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective consortium analysis.	BACKGROUND: Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. METHODS: 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. FINDINGS: 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. INTERPRETATION: While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.

4c96e1d4-1fed-5fdb-86f8-7b248ad57dc7	C	Molecular Characteristics of Repotrectinib That Enable Potent Inhibition of TRK Fusion Proteins and Resistant Mutations.	<i>NTRK</i> chromosomal rearrangements yield oncogenic TRK fusion proteins that are sensitive to TRK inhibitors (larotrectinib and entrectinib) but often mutate, limiting the durability of response for <i>NTRK</i> <sup>+</sup> patients. Next-generation inhibitors with compact macrocyclic structures (repotrectinib and selitrectinib) were designed to avoid resistance mutations. Head-to-head potency comparisons of TRK inhibitors and molecular characterization of binding interactions are incomplete, obscuring a detailed understanding of how molecular characteristics translate to potency. Larotrectinib, entrectinib, selitrectinib, and repotrectinib were characterized using cellular models of wild-type TRKA/B/C fusions and resistance mutant variants with a subset evaluated in xenograft tumor models. Crystal structures were determined for repotrectinib bound to TRKA (wild-type, solvent-front mutant). TKI-naïve and pretreated case studies are presented. Repotrectinib was the most potent inhibitor of wild-type TRKA/B/C fusions and was more potent than selitrectinib against all tested resistance mutations, underscoring the importance of distinct features of the macrocycle structures. Cocrystal structures of repotrectinib with wild-type TRKA and the TRKA<sup>G595R</sup> SFM variant elucidated how differences in macrocyclic inhibitor structure, binding orientation, and conformational flexibility affect potency and mutant selectivity. The SFM crystal structure revealed an unexpected intramolecular arginine sidechain interaction. Repotrectinib caused tumor regression in <i>LMNA-NTRK1</i> xenograft models harboring GKM, SFM, xDFG, and GKM + SFM compound mutations. Durable responses were observed in TKI-naïve and -pretreated patients with <i>NTRK</i> <sup>+</sup> cancers treated with repotrectinib (NCT03093116). This comprehensive analysis of first- and second-generation TRK inhibitors informs the clinical utility, structural determinants of inhibitor potency, and design of new generations of macrocyclic inhibitors.	B	high	The study includes preclinical evidence (cellular models, xenograft models, crystal structures) and human patient data from a clinical trial (NCT03093116), reporting durable responses in patients. The inclusion of patient data from a clinical trial, even if early phase, elevates the evidence to Level B, as it represents primary patient data from a clinical study.
65c0306f-a87f-5fb7-bee7-24a2edf79738	B	Afatinib Activity in Platinum-Refractory Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma in Patients With ERBB Alterations.	PURPOSE: Somatic mutations and copy number variation in the ERBB family are frequent in urothelial carcinoma (UC) and may represent viable therapeutic targets. We studied whether afatinib (an oral, irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family) has activity in UC and if specific ERBB molecular alterations are associated with clinical response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II trial, patients with metastatic platinum-refractory UC received afatinib 40 mg/day continuously until progression or intolerance. The primary end point was 3-month progression-free survival (PFS3). Prespecified tumor analysis for alterations in EGFR, HER2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 was conducted. RESULTS: The first-stage enrollment goal of 23 patients was met. Patient demographic data included: 78% male, median age 67 years (range, 36 to 82 years), hemoglobin < 10 g/dL in 17%, liver metastases in 30%, median time from prior chemotherapy of 3.6 months, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 1 in 100%. No unexpected toxicities were observed; two patients required dose reduction for grade 3 fatigue and rash. Overall, five of 23 patients (21.7%) met PFS3 (two partial response, three stable disease). Notably, among the 21 tumors analyzed, five of six patients (83.3%) with HER2 and/or ERBB3 alterations achieved PFS3 (PFS = 10.3, 7.0, 6.9, 6.3, and 5.0 months, respectively) versus none of 15 patients without alterations (P < .001). Three of four patients with HER2 amplification and three of three patients with ERBB3 somatic mutations (G284R, V104M, and R103G) met PFS3. One patient with both HER2 amplification and ERBB3 mutation never progressed on therapy, but treatment was discontinued after 10.3 months as a result of depressed ejection fraction. The median time to progression/discontinuation was 6.6 months in patients with HER2/ERBB3 alterations versus 1.4 months in patients without alterations (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Afatinib demonstrated significant activity in patients with platinum-refractory UC with HER2 or ERBB3 alterations. The potential contribution of ERBB3 to afatinib sensitivity is novel. Afatinib deserves further investigation in molecularly selected UC.	B	high	This is a Phase II clinical trial involving 23 patients with metastatic platinum-refractory urothelial carcinoma. The study provides statistical results regarding progression-free survival and correlation with ERBB alterations, fitting the criteria for Level B evidence (Clinical Evidence: Clinical trials (Phase I–III) or primary patient data with >5 patients with statistical results but less definitive than Level A).
43c3392c-16e3-5686-9dbd-964a25bf4f7f	B	Exon 19 deletion mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor are associated with prolonged survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib or erlotinib.	PURPOSE: Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been detected in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are associated with sensitivity to treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib. Our study explored the relationship between the two most common types of somatic EGFR mutations, exon 19 deletions and the L858R point mutation, and outcomes of patients following treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor specimens obtained before treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib were analyzed for EGFR mutations. Patients with exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations were identified. The response rate, time to progression, and overall survival were determined for the two groups. RESULTS: We identified 36 patients with NSCLC and an EGFR mutation who were treated with gefitinib or erlotinib. Patients with an exon 19 deletion had a significantly longer overall survival compared with patients with an L858R mutation (38 versus 17 months; P = 0.04). There were also trends toward higher response rate (73% versus 50%) and improved time to progression (24 versus 10 months) for the patients with an exon 19 deletion, although these were not independently significant in a multivariate analysis. A difference in response rate for patients treated with gefitinib compared with erlotinib was also noted [18 of 23 (78%) versus 3 of 9 (33%); P = 0.04]. No obvious difference in time to progression or overall survival was noted between gefitinib- and erlotinib-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NSCLC and EGFR exon 19 deletions have a longer survival following treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib compared with those with the L858R mutation. Pooling of greater numbers of patients and completion of prospective trials are needed to further define the predictive and prognostic roles of different EGFR mutations with respect to treatment with gefitinib, erlotinib, and other EGFR inhibitors.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from 36 non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib or erlotinib, which is greater than 5 patients. It presents statistical results regarding response rate, time to progression, and overall survival, but the conclusions also state that 'completion of prospective trials are needed,' indicating it is less definitive than Level A evidence.
ef3fb1dc-9a63-5440-8e75-8d992d6cb071	B	Erlotinib versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (OPTIMAL, CTONG-0802): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study.	BACKGROUND: Activating mutations in EGFR are important markers of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The OPTIMAL study compared efficacy and tolerability of the TKI erlotinib versus standard chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. METHODS: We undertook an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial at 22 centres in China. Patients older than 18 years with histologically confirmed stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and a confirmed activating mutation of EGFR (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R point mutation) received either oral erlotinib (150 mg/day) until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects, or up to four cycles of gemcitabine plus carboplatin. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a minimisation procedure and were stratified according to EGFR mutation type, histological subtype (adenocarcinoma vs non-adenocarcinoma), and smoking status. The primary outcome was progression-free survival, analysed in patients with confirmed disease who received at least one dose of study treatment. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00874419, and has completed enrolment; patients are still in follow-up. FINDINGS: 83 patients were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib and 82 to receive gemcitabine plus carboplatin; 82 in the erlotinib group and 72 in the chemotherapy group were included in analysis of the primary endpoint. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in erlotinib-treated patients than in those on chemotherapy (13.1 [95% CI 10.58-16.53] vs 4.6 [4.21-5.42] months; hazard ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.10-0.26; p<0.0001). Chemotherapy was associated with more grade 3 or 4 toxic effects than was erlotinib (including neutropenia in 30 [42%] of 72 patients and thrombocytopenia in 29 [40%] patients on chemotherapy vs no patients with either event on erlotinib); the most common grade 3 or 4 toxic effects with erlotinib were increased alanine aminotransferase concentrations (three [4%] of 83 patients) and skin rash (two [2%] patients). Chemotherapy was also associated with increased treatment-related serious adverse events (ten [14%] of 72 patients [decreased platelet count, n=8; decreased neutrophil count, n=1; hepatic dysfunction, n=1] vs two [2%] of 83 patients [both hepatic dysfunction]). INTERPRETATION: Compared with standard chemotherapy, erlotinib conferred a significant progression-free survival benefit in patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and was associated with more favourable tolerability. These findings suggest that erlotinib is important for first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.

355f6c3b-996a-5328-a3a3-7d1d55553760	C	Clinical Activity of Alectinib in Advanced RET-Rearranged Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Chromosomal rearrangements involving rearranged during transfection gene (RET) occur in 1% to 2% of NSCLCs and may confer sensitivity to rearranged during transfection (RET) inhibitors. Alectinib is an anaplastic lymphoma kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that also has anti-RET activity in vitro. The clinical activity of alectinib in patients with RET-rearranged NSCLC has not yet been reported. METHODS: We have described four patients with advanced RET-rearranged NSCLC who were treated with alectinib (600 mg twice daily [n = 3] or 900 mg twice daily [n = 1]) as part of single-patient compassionate use protocols or off-label use of the commercially available drug. RESULTS: Four patients with metastatic RET-rearranged NSCLC were identified. Three of the four had received prior RET TKIs, including cabozantinib and experimental RET inhibitors. In total, we observed two (50%) objective radiographic responses after treatment with alectinib (one confirmed and one unconfirmed), with durations of therapy of 6 months and more than 5 months (treatment ongoing), respectively. Notably, one of these two patients had his dose of alectinib escalated to 900 mg twice daily and had clinical improvement in central nervous system metastases. In addition, one patient (25%) experienced a best response of stable disease lasting approximately 6 weeks (the drug discontinued for toxicity). A fourth patient who was RET TKI-naive had primary progression while receiving alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: Alectinib demonstrated preliminary antitumor activity in patients with advanced RET-rearranged NSCLC, most of whom had received prior RET inhibitors. Larger prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed to assess the efficacy of alectinib in RET-rearranged NSCLC and other RET-driven malignancies. In parallel, development of more selective, potent RET TKIs is warranted.

42491f0e-2ddc-594a-a544-1bc9c7cd0e34	D	Epigenetic silencing of argininosuccinate synthetase confers resistance to platinum-induced cell death but collateral sensitivity to arginine auxotrophy in ovarian cancer.	Evidence indicates that acquired resistance of cancers to chemotherapeutic agents can occur via epigenetic mechanisms. Down-regulation of expression of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of arginine, has been associated with the development of platinum resistance in ovarian cancer treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. The aim of the present study was to analyse epigenetic regulation of ASS1 in ovarian cancer tissue taken at diagnosis and relapse and determine its significance as a predictor of clinical outcome in patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. In addition, expression and epigenetic regulation of ASS1 were analysed in human ovarian cancer cell lines, and ASS1 expression correlated with the ability of the lines to grow in media containing cisplatin, carboplatin or taxol or in arginine-depleted media. Our results show that aberrant methylation in the ASS1 promoter correlated with transcriptional silencing in ovarian cancer cell lines. ASS1 silencing conferred selective resistance to platinum-based drugs and conferred arginine auxotrophy and sensitivity to arginine deprivation. In ovarian cancer, ASS1 methylation at diagnosis was associated with significantly reduced overall survival (p = 0.01) and relapse-free survival (p = 0.01). In patients who relapse, ASS1 methylation was significantly more frequent at relapse (p = 0.008). These data establish epigenetic inactivation of ASS1 as a determinant of response to platinum chemotherapy and imply that transcriptional silencing of ASS1 contributes to treatment failure and clinical relapse in ovarian cancer. The collateral sensitivity of cells lacking endogenous ASS1 to arginine depletion suggests novel therapeutic strategies for the management of relapsed ovarian cancer.	B	high	The study includes analysis of primary human patient data, specifically ovarian cancer tissue taken at diagnosis and relapse, and correlates ASS1 methylation with clinical outcomes such as overall survival and relapse-free survival, providing statistical results (p-values). This indicates a patient cohort likely greater than 5, fitting the criteria for Level B. While the study also includes preclinical cell line data (Level D), the significant human patient data analysis elevates the overall evidence level.

We report that TG101348, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of JAK2 with an in vitro IC50 of approximately 3 nM, shows therapeutic efficacy in a murine model of myeloproliferative disease induced by the JAK2V617F mutation. In treated animals, there was a statistically significant reduction in hematocrit and leukocyte count, a dose-dependent reduction/elimination of extramedullary hematopoiesis, and, at least in some instances, evidence for attenuation of myelofibrosis. There were no apparent toxicities and no effect on T cell number. In vivo responses were correlated with surrogate endpoints, including reduction/elimination of JAK2V617F disease burden assessed by quantitative genomic PCR, suppression of endogenous erythroid colony formation, and in vivo inhibition of JAK-STAT signal transduction as assessed by flow cytometric measurement of phosphorylated Stat5.

PURPOSE: This first-in-human phase I trial assessed the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antitumor activity of apitolisib (GDC-0980), a dual inhibitor of class I PI3K, and mTOR kinases. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Once-daily oral apitolisib was administered to patients with solid tumors for days 1 to 21 or 1 to 28 of 28-day cycles. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 120 patients were treated at doses between 2 and 70 mg. The commonest ≥G3 toxicities related to apitolisib at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) at 40 mg once daily included hyperglycemia (18%), rash (14%), liver dysfunction (12%), diarrhea (10%), pneumonitis (8%), mucosal inflammation (6%), and fatigue (4%). Dose-limiting toxicities (1 patient each) were G4 fasting hyperglycemia at 40 mg (21/28 schedule) and G3 maculopapular rash and G3 fasting hyperglycemia at 70 mg (21/28 schedule). The pharmacokinetic profile was dose-proportional. Phosphorylated serine-473 AKT levels were suppressed by ≥90% in platelet-rich plasma within 4 hours at the MTD (50 mg). Pharmacodynamic decreases in fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography uptake of >25% occurred in 66% (21/32) of patients dosed at 40 mg once daily. Evidence of single-agent activity included 10 RECIST partial responses (PR; confirmed for peritoneal mesothelioma, PIK3CA mutant head-and-neck cancer, and three pleural mesotheliomas). CONCLUSIONS: Apitolisib exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with target modulation at doses ≥16 mg. The RP2D was 40 mg once-daily 28/28 schedule; severe on-target toxicities were apparent at ≥40 mg, particularly pneumonitis. Apitolisib was reasonably tolerated at 30 mg, the selected dose for pleural mesothelioma patients given limited respiratory reserve. Modest but durable antitumor activity was demonstrated.

d48023f5-2a4e-5ee5-952c-ff749f4718cb	D	ATM mutations uniformly lead to ATM dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: application of functional test using doxorubicin.	ATM abnormalities are frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and represent an important prognostic factor. Sole 11q deletion does not result in ATM inactivation by contrast to biallelic defects involving mutations. Therefore, the analysis of ATM mutations and their functional impact is crucial. In this study, we analyzed ATM mutations in predominantly high-risk patients using: i) resequencing microarray and direct sequencing; ii) Western blot for total ATM level; iii) functional test based on p21 gene induction after parallel treatment of leukemic cells with fludarabine and doxorubicin. ATM dysfunction leads to impaired p21 induction after doxorubicin exposure. We detected ATM mutation in 16% (22 of 140) of patients, and all mutated samples manifested demonstrable ATM defect (impaired p21 upregulation after doxorubicin and/or null protein level). Loss of ATM function in mutated samples was also evidenced through defective p53 pathway activation after ionizing radiation exposure. ATM mutation frequency was 34% in patients with 11q deletion, 4% in the TP53-defected group, and 8% in wild-type patients. Our functional test, convenient for routine use, showed high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (97%) for ATM mutations prediction. Only cells with ATM mutation, but not those with sole 11q deletion, were resistant to doxorubicin. As far as fludarabine is concerned, this difference was not observed. Interestingly, patients from both these groups experienced nearly identical time to first treatment. In conclusion, ATM mutations either alone or in combination with 11q deletion uniformly led to demonstrable ATM dysfunction in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mutation presence can be predicted by the functional test using doxorubicin.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from 140 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

fc200005-2f22-57bb-b056-a2836aa7b49d	C	Extended Antitumor Response of a BRAF V600E Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma to Vemurafenib.	CONTEXT: For patients with metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment, systemic chemotherapy has limited efficacy. Such tumors frequently harbor BRAF V600E, and this alteration may predict responsiveness to vemurafenib treatment. OBJECTIVE: We report a metastatic PTC patient refractory to RAI treatment that underwent genomic profiling by next-generation sequencing. The sole genomic alteration identified was BRAF V600E on a near diploid genome with trisomy 1q. With vemurafenib treatment, the patient experienced a dramatic radiographic and clinical improvement, with the duration of an ongoing antitumor response exceeding 23 months. DESIGN: Hybridization capture of 3,769 exons of 236 cancer-related genes and the introns of 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer was applied to >50 ng of DNA extracted from a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy of a lymph node containing metastatic PTC and was sequenced to a high, uniform coverage of ×616. RESULTS: A BRAF V600E alteration was identified with no other somatic genomic alterations present within a near diploid tumor genome. The patient initially received vemurafenib at 960 mg twice daily that was reduced to 480 mg twice daily due to rash and diarrhea and has experienced an ongoing antitumor response exceeding 23 months by both PET-CT and dedicated CT imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic profiling in metastatic, RAI-refractory PTC can reveal a targetable BRAF V600E alteration without compounding somatic alterations, and such patients may derive a more prolonged benefit from vemurafenib treatment. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to confirm our preliminary observation.

7506062f-fff2-51c3-a3e5-78a1ff6c5dee	B	Safety and activity of alectinib against systemic disease and brain metastases in patients with crizotinib-resistant ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (AF-002JG): results from the dose-finding portion of a phase 1/2 study.	BACKGROUND: Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ALK rearrangements generally have a progression-free survival of 8-11 months while on treatment with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. However, resistance inevitably develops, with the brain a common site of progression. More potent ALK inhibitors with consistently demonstrable CNS activity and good tolerability are needed urgently. Alectinib is a novel, highly selective, and potent ALK inhibitor that has shown clinical activity in patients with crizotinib-naive ALK-rearranged NSCLC. We did a phase 1/2 study of alectinib to establish the recommended phase 2 dose of the drug and examine its activity in patients resistant or intolerant to crizotinib. METHODS: We enrolled patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC who progressed on or were intolerant to crizotinib. We administered various oral doses of alectinib (300-900 mg twice a day) during the dose-escalation portion of the study (phase 1), to ascertain the recommended dose for phase 2. We used Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (version 1.1) to investigate the activity of alectinib in all patients with a baseline scan and at least one post-treatment scan (CT or MRI), with central radiological review of individuals with brain metastases. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of alectinib. Here, we present data for the phase 1 portion of the study, the primary objective of which was to establish the recommended phase 2 dose; phase 2 is ongoing. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01588028. FINDINGS: 47 patients were enrolled. Alectinib was well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being fatigue (14 [30%]; all grade 1-2), myalgia (eight [17%]; all grade 1-2), and peripheral oedema (seven [15%] grade 1-2, one [2%] grade 3). Dose-limiting toxic effects were recorded in two patients in the cohort receiving alectinib 900 mg twice a day; one individual had grade 3 headache and the other had grade 3 neutropenia. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were increased levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (two [4%]), a reduction in the number of neutrophils (two [4%]), and hypophosphataemia (two [4%]). Three patients reported four grade 4 serious adverse events that were deemed unrelated to alectinib: acute renal failure; pleural effusion and pericardial effusion; and brain metastasis. At data cut-off (median follow-up 126 days [IQR 84-217]), 44 patients could be assessed for activity. Investigator-assessed objective responses were noted in 24 (55%) patients, with a confirmed complete response in one (2%), a confirmed partial response in 14 (32%), and an unconfirmed partial response in nine (20%). 16 (36%) patients had stable disease; the remaining four (9%) had progressive disease. Of 21 patients with CNS metastases at baseline, 11 (52%) had an objective response; six (29%) had a complete response (three unconfirmed) and five (24%) had a partial response (one unconfirmed); eight (38%) patients had stable disease and the remaining two (10%) had progressive disease. Pharmacokinetic data indicated that mean exposure (AUC0-10) after multiple doses of alectinib (300-600 mg twice a day) was dose-dependent. INTERPRETATION: Alectinib was well tolerated, with promising antitumour activity in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC resistant to crizotinib, including those with CNS metastases. On the basis of activity, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data, we chose alectinib 600 mg twice a day as the recommended dose for phase 2. FUNDING: Chugai Pharmaceuticals, F Hoffmann La-Roche.

ec2a2cb6-7df0-5f20-a0c7-9cf409387f62	D	ESR1 ligand-binding domain mutations in hormone-resistant breast cancer.	Seventy percent of breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER), and most of these are sensitive to ER inhibition. However, many such tumors for unknown reasons become refractory to inhibition of estrogen action in the metastatic setting. We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of two independent cohorts of metastatic ER-positive breast tumors and identified mutations in ESR1 affecting the ligand-binding domain (LBD) in 14 of 80 cases. These included highly recurrent mutations encoding p.Tyr537Ser, p.Tyr537Asn and p.Asp538Gly alterations. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the structures of the Tyr537Ser and Asp538Gly mutants involve hydrogen bonding of the mutant amino acids with Asp351, thus favoring the agonist conformation of the receptor. Consistent with this model, mutant receptors drive ER-dependent transcription and proliferation in the absence of hormone and reduce the efficacy of ER antagonists. These data implicate LBD-mutant forms of ER in mediating clinical resistance to hormonal therapy and suggest that more potent ER antagonists may be of substantial therapeutic benefit.	B	high	The study involves a comprehensive genetic analysis of two independent cohorts of metastatic ER-positive breast tumors, identifying mutations in 14 of 80 cases. This constitutes primary patient data with more than 5 patients, aligning with the definition of Level B evidence.
82188e92-7fa4-5b7a-bf91-1cd3a414ef64	B	Gene expression markers of efficacy and resistance to cetuximab treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer: results from CALGB 80203 (Alliance).	PURPOSE: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from CALGB 80203 were analyzed for expression of EGFR axis-related genes to identify prognostic or predictive biomarkers for cetuximab treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (238 total) with first-line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) were randomized to FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy ± cetuximab. qRT-PCR analyses were conducted on tissues from 103 patients at baseline to measure gene expression levels of HER-related genes, including amphiregulin (AREG), betacellulin (BTC), NT5E (CD73), DUSP4, EGF, EGFR, epigen (EPGN), epiregulin (EREG), HBEGF, ERBB2 (HER2), ERBB3 (HER3), ERBB4 (HER4), PHLDA1, and TGFA. The interactions between expression levels and treatment with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were modeled using multiplicative Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: High tumor mRNA levels of HER2 [hazard ratio (HR), 0.64; P = 0.002] and EREG (HR, 0.89; P = 0.016) were prognostic markers associated with longer PFS across all patients. HER3 and CD73 expression levels were identified as potential predictive markers of benefit from cetuximab. In KRAS wild-type (WT) tumors, low HER3 expression was associated with longer OS from cetuximab treatment, whereas high HER3 expression was associated with shorter OS from cetuximab treatment (chemo + cetuximab: HR, 1.15; chemo-only: HR, 0.48; Pinteraction = 0.029). High CD73 expression was associated with longer PFS from cetuximab treatment in patients with KRAS-WT (chemo + cetuximab: HR, 0.91; chemo-only: HR, 1.57; Pinteraction = 0.026) and KRAS-mutant (Mut) tumors (chemo + cetuximab: HR, 0.80; chemo-only: HR, 1.29; P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression of HER3 and CD73 was identified as a potential predictive marker for cetuximab. These data implicate HER axis signaling and immune modulation as potential mechanisms of cetuximab action and sensitivity.	B	high	This publication reports on a correlative study conducted within a large, randomized clinical trial (CALGB 80203) involving 238 patients, with gene expression analysis performed on 103 patients. It presents primary patient data with statistical results (hazard ratios, p-values) to identify potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers. While the source is a Phase III trial, the findings are described as identifying 'potential predictive markers,' suggesting they are strong clinical evidence but not yet a 'proven/consensus association' or 'practice-changing evidence' as typically required for Level A.
9e4faf99-4d70-505e-b46b-f36d1f91ec74	B	Phase I expansion and pharmacodynamic study of the oral MEK inhibitor RO4987655 (CH4987655) in selected patients with advanced cancer with RAS-RAF mutations.	PURPOSE: This phase I expansion study assessed safety, pharmacodynamic effects, and antitumor activity of RO4987655, a pure MEK inhibitor, in selected patients with advanced solid tumor. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We undertook a multicenter phase I two-part study (dose escalation and cohort expansion). Here, we present the part 2 expansion that included melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and colorectal cancer with oral RO4987655 administered continuously at recommended doses of 8.5 mg twice daily until progressive disease (PD). Sequential tumor sampling investigated multiple markers of pathway activation/tumor effects, including ERK phosphorylation and Ki-67 expression. BRAF and KRAS testing were implemented as selection criteria and broader tumor mutational analysis added. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients received RO4987655, including 18 BRAF-mutant melanoma, 23 BRAF wild-type melanoma, 24 KRAS-mutant NSCLC, and 30 KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer. Most frequent adverse events were rash, acneiform dermatitis, and gastrointestinal disorders, mostly grade 1/2. Four (24%) of 17 BRAF-mutated melanoma had partial response as did four (20%) of 20 BRAF wild-type melanoma and two (11%) of 18 KRAS-mutant NSCLC. All KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer developed PD. Paired tumor biopsies demonstrated reduced ERK phosphorylation among all cohorts but significant differences among cohorts in Ki-67 modulation. Sixty-nine percent showed a decrease in fluorodeoxyglucose uptake between baseline and day 15. Detailed mutational profiling confirmed RAS/RAF screening and identified additional aberrations (NRAS/non-BRAF melanomas; PIK3CA/KRAS colorectal cancer) without therapeutic implications. CONCLUSIONS: Safety profile of RO4987655 was comparable with other MEK inhibitors. Single-agent activity was observed in all entities except colorectal cancer. Evidence of target modulation and early biologic activity was shown among all indications independent of mutational status. Clin Cancer Res; 20(16); 4251-61. ©2014 AACR.

bf55c88a-6f67-5a2a-95d8-934b09322a54	B	Do AML patients with DNMT3A exon 23 mutations benefit from idarubicin as compared to daunorubicin? A single center experience.	Mutations in DNMT3A encoding DNA methyltransferase 3A were recently described in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. To assess their prognostic significance, we determined the mutational status of DNMT3A exon 23 in 288 patients with AML excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia, aged from 18 to 65 years and treated in Toulouse University Hospital. A mutation was detected in 39 patients (13.5%). All DNMT3A exon 23+ patients had intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Mutations significantly correlated with a higher WBC count (p less than 0.001), NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations (p=0.027). DNMT3A mutations were conserved through xenotransplantation in immunodeficient mice. No difference in outcome between DNMT3A exon 23+ and DNMT3A exon 23- patients was found even if the results were stratified by NPM1 or FLT3-ITD status. However, DNMT3A exon 23+ patients had better median DFS (not reached vs 11.6 months, p=0.009) and OS (not reached vs 14.3 months, p=0.005) as compared to DNMT3A exon 23- patients when treated with idarubicin, whereas patients treated with daunorubicin had similar outcome regardless the DNMT3A status. This study shows that DNMT3A mutations have no impact on outcome but could be a predictive factor for response to idarubicin and thus, could have a direct influence in the way AML patients should be managed.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from 288 human patients, which is a substantial cohort. It presents statistical results (p-values for DFS and OS) indicating a potential predictive factor for response to idarubicin. While it suggests clinical implications, it is a single-center experience and not a multi-center randomized controlled trial or a practice-changing guideline, thus not meeting the criteria for Level A. The inclusion of preclinical data (xenotransplantation) is secondary to the main human patient analysis.
71e86894-dadd-5b3e-aaf2-b94119895ed7	A	Alectinib versus crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (J-ALEX): an open-label, randomised phase 3 trial.	BACKGROUND: Alectinib, a potent, highly selective, CNS-active inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), showed promising efficacy and tolerability in the single-arm phase 1/2 AF-001JP trial in Japanese patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Given those promising results, we did a phase 3 trial to directly compare the efficacy and safety of alectinib and crizotinib. METHODS: J-ALEX was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial that recruited ALK inhibitor-naive Japanese patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, who were chemotherapy-naive or had received one previous chemotherapy regimen, from 41 study sites in Japan. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive web response system using a permuted-block method stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, treatment line, and disease stage to receive oral alectinib 300 mg twice daily or crizotinib 250 mg twice daily until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by an independent review facility. The efficacy analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population, and safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. The study is ongoing and patient recruitment is closed. This study is registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center (number JapicCTI-132316). FINDINGS: Between Nov 18, 2013, and Aug 4, 2015, 207 patients were recruited and assigned to the alectinib (n=103) or crizotinib (n=104) groups. At data cutoff for the second interim analysis, 24 patients in the alectinib group had discontinued treatment compared with 61 in the crizotinib group, mostly due to lack of efficacy or adverse events. At the second interim analysis (data cutoff date Dec 3, 2015), an independent data monitoring committee determined that the primary endpoint of the study had been met (hazard ratio 0·34 [99·7% CI 0·17-0·71], stratified log-rank p<0·0001) and recommended an immediate release of the data. Median progression-free survival had not yet been reached with alectinib (95% CI 20·3-not estimated) and was 10·2 months (8·2-12·0) with crizotinib. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred at a greater frequency with crizotinib (54 [52%] of 104) than alectinib (27 [26%] of 103). Dose interruptions due to adverse events were also more prevalent with crizotinib (77 [74%] of 104) than with alectinib (30 [29%] of 103), and more patients receiving crizotinib (21 [20%]) than alectinib (nine [9%]) discontinued the study drug because of an adverse event. No adverse events with a fatal outcome occurred in either treatment group. INTERPRETATION: These results provide the first head-to-head comparison of alectinib and crizotinib and have the potential to change the standard of care for the first-line treatment of ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. The dose of alectinib (300 mg twice daily) used in this study is lower than the approved dose in countries other than Japan; however, this limitation is being addressed in the ongoing ALEX study. FUNDING: Chugai Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd.	A	high	The publication describes a randomised, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial (J-ALEX) involving 207 human patients.

This aligns with the definition of Level A, which includes Phase III clinical trials and practice-changing evidence.
f34b4a80-ce0a-5a08-9af1-5345edacc9cb	D	The T790M mutation in EGFR kinase causes drug resistance by increasing the affinity for ATP.	"Lung cancers caused by activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are initially responsive to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but the efficacy of these agents is often limited because of the emergence of drug resistance conferred by a second mutation, T790M. Threonine 790 is the ""gatekeeper"" residue, an important determinant of inhibitor specificity in the ATP binding pocket. The T790M mutation has been thought to cause resistance by sterically blocking binding of TKIs such as gefitinib and erlotinib, but this explanation is difficult to reconcile with the fact that it remains sensitive to structurally similar irreversible inhibitors. Here, we show by using a direct binding assay that T790M mutants retain low-nanomolar affinity for gefitinib. Furthermore, we show that the T790M mutation activates WT EGFR and that introduction of the T790M mutation increases the ATP affinity of the oncogenic L858R mutant by more than an order of magnitude. The increased ATP affinity is the primary mechanism by which the T790M mutation confers drug resistance. Crystallographic analysis of the T790M mutant shows how it can adapt to accommodate tight binding of diverse inhibitors, including the irreversible inhibitor HKI-272, and also suggests a structural mechanism for catalytic activation. We conclude that the T790M mutation is a ""generic"" resistance mutation that will reduce the potency of any ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor and that irreversible inhibitors overcome this resistance simply through covalent binding, not as a result of an alternative binding mode."	D	high	The abstract describes experiments using direct binding assays and crystallographic analysis to investigate the molecular mechanism of the T790M mutation. This involves studying mutant proteins and their interactions, which are characteristic of in vitro or preclinical models, not direct human evidence or clinical trials.
ca8dfb42-db30-503b-81af-a927a2f3466c	D	Mutant HRAS as novel target for MEK and mTOR inhibitors.	HRAS is a frequently mutated oncogene in cancer. However, mutant HRAS as drug target has not been investigated so far. Here, we show that mutant HRAS hyperactivates the RAS and the mTOR pathway in various cancer cell lines including lung, bladder and esophageal cancer. HRAS mutation sensitized toward growth inhibition by the MEK inhibitors AZD6244, MEK162 and PD0325901. Further, we found that MEK inhibitors induce apoptosis in mutant HRAS cell lines but not in cell lines lacking RAS mutations. In addition, knockdown of HRAS by siRNA blocked cell growth in mutant HRAS cell lines. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors did not alter signaling nor had an impact on viability. However, inhibition of mTOR or combined inhibition of MEK and mTOR reduced cell growth in a synergistic manner. Finally, Ba/F3 cells transformed with mutant HRAS isoforms Q61L, Q61R and G12V demonstrated equal sensitivity towards MEK and mTOR inhibition. Our results show that HRAS mutations in cancer activate the RAS and mTOR pathways which might serve as a therapeutic option for patients with HRAS mutant tumors.	D	high	The abstract describes experiments conducted in 'various cancer cell lines' and 'Ba/F3 cells transformed with mutant HRAS isoforms', which are in vitro models.

ad0bcde3-691a-57d8-86b6-4838738fe232	B	Phase 1 study of tazemetostat in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma.	BACKGROUND: Tazemetostat is a selective and orally available inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase and epigenetic regulator of cellular differentiation programs. We carried out a phase I study of tazemetostat in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin-type lymphoma (B-NHL) to evaluate its tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity. METHODS: Tazemetostat was given orally at a single dose of 800 mg on the first day and 800 mg twice daily (BID: total 1600 mg/d) on following days in a 28-day/cycle manner. Tazemetostat dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated up to the end of the first treatment cycle. Archival tumor tissues were analyzed for hotspot EZH2 mutations. RESULTS: As of 15 January 2018, seven patients (four follicular lymphoma [FL] and three diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]) were enrolled. The median age was 73 (range, 59-85) years, and the median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was three (range, one to five). No DLT was observed (one patient was not evaluable due to early disease progression). The common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were thrombocytopenia and dysgeusia (three patients each; 42.9%). No treatment-related serious AEs were observed. The objective response rate was 57% (4/7 patients), including responses in three of four patients with FL and one of three patients with DLBCL. An EZH2 mutation was detected in one patient with FL responding to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Tazemetostat at 800 mg BID showed an acceptable safety profile and promising antitumor activity in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory B-NHL.	B	high	This is a Phase 1 clinical trial involving 7 human patients, which is greater than 5. The study evaluates safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity, and presents statistical results such as objective response rate and adverse events. This aligns with the definition of Level B for clinical trials with statistical results but less definitive than Level A.
5d0bb35c-a311-5e64-a639-252b4ca626b5	D	Activating HER2 mutations in HER2 gene amplification negative breast cancer.	UNLABELLED: Data from 8 breast cancer genome-sequencing projects identified 25 patients with HER2 somatic mutations in cancers lacking HER2 gene amplification. To determine the phenotype of these mutations, we functionally characterized 13 HER2 mutations using in vitro kinase assays, protein structure analysis, cell culture, and xenograft experiments. Seven of these mutations are activating mutations, including G309A, D769H, D769Y, V777L, P780ins, V842I, and R896C. HER2 in-frame deletion 755-759, which is homologous to EGF receptor (EGFR) exon 19 in-frame deletions, had a neomorphic phenotype with increased phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3. L755S produced lapatinib resistance, but was not an activating mutation in our experimental systems. All of these mutations were sensitive to the irreversible kinase inhibitor, neratinib. These findings show that HER2 somatic mutation is an alternative mechanism to activate HER2 in breast cancer and they validate HER2 somatic mutations as drug targets for breast cancer treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: We show that the majority of HER2 somatic mutations in breast cancer patients are activating mutations that likely drive tumorigenesis. Several patients had mutations that are resistant to the reversible HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, but are sensitive to the irreversible HER2 inhibitor, neratinib. Our results suggest that patients with HER2 mutation–positive breast cancers could benefit from existing HER2-targeted drugs.	D	high	The study identified HER2 somatic mutations in 25 patients from genome-sequencing projects. However, the functional characterization of these mutations and their sensitivity to drugs (lapatinib and neratinib) were determined using in vitro kinase assays, protein structure analysis, cell culture, and xenograft experiments. These are all preclinical models, not direct human clinical evidence of efficacy or patient outcomes.
f3b16dec-8962-5ff6-aae8-5f26998dd8e6	C	Response to angiotensin blockade with irbesartan in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer.	BACKGROUND: A patient suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer, treatment-related toxicity and resistance to standard chemotherapy and radiation was assessed as part of a personalized oncogenomics initiative to derive potential alternative therapeutic strategies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing was used to interrogate a metastatic tumor refractory to standard treatments of a patient with mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Integrative genomic analysis indicated overexpression of the AP-1 transcriptional complex suggesting experimental therapeutic rationales, including blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. This led to the repurposing of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, as an anticancer therapy, resulting in the patient experiencing a dramatic and durable response. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the utility of comprehensive integrative genomic profiling and bioinformatics analysis to provide hypothetical rationales for personalized treatment options.	C	high	The abstract explicitly states that the study involves 'a patient' and refers to the findings as 'This case', indicating it is a single-patient case report. This aligns with the definition of Level C evidence.
f4bae7e4-feda-56ee-ba15-09c8bfb86335	D	MEK1 mutations confer resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibition.	Genetic alterations that activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway occur commonly in cancer. For example, the majority of melanomas harbor mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which are predicted to confer enhanced sensitivity to pharmacologic MAP kinase inhibition (e.g., RAF or MEK inhibitors). We investigated the clinical relevance of MEK dependency in melanoma by massively parallel sequencing of resistant clones generated from a MEK1 random mutagenesis screen in vitro, as well as tumors obtained from relapsed patients following treatment with AZD6244, an allosteric MEK inhibitor. Most mutations conferring resistance to MEK inhibition in vitro populated the allosteric drug binding pocket or alpha-helix C and showed robust ( approximately 100-fold) resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition. Other mutations affected MEK1 codons located within or abutting the N-terminal negative regulatory helix (helix A), which also undergo gain-of-function germline mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. One such mutation, MEK1(P124L), was identified in a resistant metastatic focus that emerged in a melanoma patient treated with AZD6244. Both MEK1(P124L) and MEK1(Q56P), which disrupts helix A, conferred cross-resistance to PLX4720, a selective B-RAF inhibitor. However, exposing BRAF-mutant melanoma cells to AZD6244 and PLX4720 in combination prevented emergence of resistant clones. These results affirm the importance of MEK dependency in BRAF-mutant melanoma and suggest novel mechanisms of resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibitors that may have important clinical implications.	C	high	The study primarily involves preclinical (in vitro) experiments to identify resistance mechanisms. However, it also includes direct human evidence by analyzing 'tumors obtained from relapsed patients' and specifically identifying a mutation (MEK1(P124L)) in 'a melanoma patient'. While patient data is included, the abstract does not indicate a large patient cohort (>5 patients) or present statistical results from such a cohort that would qualify it for Level B. The description of patient data aligns best with a case study or a very small patient series.
20744627-d206-5ab8-a417-c763750dfbef	D	Axitinib effectively inhibits BCR-ABL1(T315I) with a distinct binding conformation.	The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is a driver oncogene in chronic myeloid leukaemia and 30-50% of cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Introduction of ABL1 kinase inhibitors (for example, imatinib) has markedly improved patient survival, but acquired drug resistance remains a challenge. Point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain weaken inhibitor binding and represent the most common clinical resistance mechanism. The BCR-ABL1 kinase domain gatekeeper mutation Thr315Ile (T315I) confers resistance to all approved ABL1 inhibitors except ponatinib, which has toxicity limitations. Here we combine comprehensive drug sensitivity and resistance profiling of patient cells ex vivo with structural analysis to establish the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a selective and effective inhibitor for T315I-mutant BCR-ABL1-driven leukaemia. Axitinib potently inhibited BCR-ABL1(T315I), at both biochemical and cellular levels, by binding to the active form of ABL1(T315I) in a mutation-selective binding mode. These findings suggest that the T315I mutation shifts the conformational equilibrium of the kinase in favour of an active (DFG-in) A-loop conformation, which has more optimal binding interactions with axitinib. Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unexpected opportunity to repurpose axitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug approved for renal cancer, as an inhibitor for ABL1 gatekeeper mutant drug-resistant leukaemia patients. This study shows that wild-type proteins do not always sample the conformations available to disease-relevant mutant proteins and that comprehensive drug testing of patient-derived cells can identify unpredictable, clinically significant drug-repositioning opportunities.	C	high	The study includes preclinical evidence from ex vivo patient cells and biochemical/cellular assays. Crucially, it also reports on the treatment of 'a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient,' which constitutes a single-patient case study.
918ac2f4-e81c-5a94-8ead-8c3e39c771eb	B	Topoisomerase-II alpha expression as a predictive marker in a population of advanced breast cancer patients randomly treated either with single-agent doxorubicin or single-agent docetaxel.	PURPOSE: The predictive value of topoisomerase-II alpha (topo-II) has been evaluated in advanced breast cancer patients randomly treated with single-agent doxorubicin or docetaxel. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary tumor samples from patients enrolled in a randomized, phase III clinical trial comparing single-agent doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2) q3wks) with docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) q3wks) were collected and topo-II status was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (clone KiS1). RESULTS: Topo-II status was evaluated in 108 samples, 55 (51%) in the doxorubicin arm and 53 (49%) in the docetaxel arm. An increment of 10% in cells expressing topo-II is associated with a statistically significant odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval) of 1.09 (1.03-1.15; P = 0.002) for overall response to doxorubicin versus 1.002 (0.94-1.07; P = 0.95) in the docetaxel arm. With increasing topo-II, the favorable OR for overall response to docetaxel compared with doxorubicin decreases to become not significant in patients with topo-II tumor content >10%. In a multivariate analysis, (a) HER-2 status seems positively correlated with overall response to chemotherapy (OR, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-6.27; P = 0.09). (b) Overall response to doxorubicin is significantly lower than overall response to docetaxel (OR, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.64; P = 0.009) but with a significant interaction term for doxorubicin-treated patients with topo-II tumor content >10% (OR, 8.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.86-37.03; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: (a) Topo-II overexpression confers a higher probability of response in the doxorubicin arm only. (b) Despite being a small retrospective study, this study is in line with previously reported studies and the hypotheses raised are now being tested in a prospective neoadjuvant trial.	B	high	The study is a retrospective analysis of a biomarker (topo-II alpha) using samples collected from patients enrolled in a randomized, phase III clinical trial. While the patient data originates from a high-quality clinical trial, the biomarker analysis itself is retrospective and described by the authors as a 'small retrospective study.' It involves human patient data (>5 patients) and provides statistical results, fitting the criteria for Level B. The conclusion also notes that the hypotheses raised are being tested in a prospective trial, suggesting this study is not yet considered definitive or 'practice-changing' for the biomarker's predictive value, which would be a characteristic of Level A.
43c49a6e-3764-583c-88ce-2bf0120c59f6	B	Binimetinib versus dacarbazine in patients with advanced NRAS-mutant melanoma (NEMO): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.	BACKGROUND: There are no established therapies specific for NRAS-mutant melanoma despite the emergence of immunotherapy. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the MEK inhibitor binimetinib versus that of dacarbazine in patients with advanced NRAS-mutant melanoma. METHODS: NEMO is an ongoing, randomised, open-label phase 3 study done at 118 hospitals in 26 countries. Patients with advanced, unresectable, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IIIC or stage IV NRAS-mutant melanoma who were previously untreated or had progressed on or after previous immunotherapy were randomised (2:1) to receive either binimetinib 45 mg orally twice daily or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously every 3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by stage, performance status, and previous immunotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by blinded central review in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses were done in the safety population, consisting of all patients who received at least one study drug dose and one post-baseline safety assessment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01763164 and with EudraCT, number 2012-003593-51. FINDINGS: Between Aug 19, 2013, and April 28, 2015, 402 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, 269 to binimetinib and 133 to dacarbazine. Median follow-up was 1·7 months (IQR 1·4-4·1). Median progression-free survival was 2·8 months (95% CI 2·8-3·6) in the binimetinib group and 1·5 months (1·5-1·7) in the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio 0·62 [95% CI 0·47-0·80]; one-sided p<0·001). Grade 3-4 adverse events seen in at least 5% of patients the safety population in either group were increased creatine phosphokinase (52 [19%] of 269 patients in the binimetinib group vs none of 114 in the dacarbazine group), hypertension (20 [7%] vs two [2%]), anaemia (five [2%] vs six [5%]), and neutropenia (two [1%] vs ten [9%]). Serious adverse events (all grades) occurred in 91 (34%) patients in the binimetinib group and 25 (22%) patients in the dacarbazine group. INTERPRETATION: Binimetinib improved progression-free survival compared with dacarbazine and was tolerable. Binimetinib might represent a new treatment option for patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma after failure of immunotherapy. FUNDING: Array BioPharma and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.

828c6d97-63a7-564c-9211-e07b04fac2af	C	Clinical activity of afatinib (BIBW 2992) in patients with lung adenocarcinoma with mutations in the kinase domain of HER2/neu.	Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2/neu kinase domain mutations are found in approximately 1-4% of lung adenocarcinomas with a similar phenotype to tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Afatinib is a potent irreversible ErbB family blocker. We determined the tumor genomic status of the EGFR and HER2 genes in non- or light smokers with lung adenocarcinoma in patients who were entered into an exploratory Phase II study with afatinib. Five patients with a non-smoking history and metastatic lung adenocarcinomas bearing mutations in the kinase domain of HER2 gene were identified, three of which were evaluable for response. Objective response was observed in all three patients, even after failure of other EGFR- and/or HER2-targeted treatments; the case histories of these patients are described in this report. These findings suggest that afatinib is a potential novel treatment option for this subgroup of patients, even when other EGFR and HER2 targeting treatments have failed.	C	high	The study describes an exploratory Phase II study, but only three patients were evaluable for response, which falls under the definition of a 'very small patient series (<5 patients)' or 'case reports' as per Level C.

74bb408d-5d9b-5e57-95bb-b7d78a2d5026	D	MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib (PF-02341066) shows differential antitumor effects in non-small cell lung cancer according to MET alterations.	INTRODUCTION: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeted to MET are undergoing clinical trials in patients with solid tumors, but the precise mechanism of the antitumor activity of these drugs remains unclear. We examined the antitumor action of the MET-TKI crizotinib (PF-02341066) in lung cancer cells that are positive or negative for MET amplification or mutation. METHODS: The antitumor action of crizotinib was evaluated on the basis of signal transduction, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and progression of tumor xenografts. RESULTS: Inhibition of MET signaling by crizotinib or by RNA interference-mediated MET depletion resulted in the induction of apoptosis accompanied by inhibition of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in lung cancer cells with MET amplification but not in cells with a MET mutation or in those without amplification or mutation of MET. These results suggest that MET signaling is essential for the survival of cells with MET amplification but not for that of cells without this genetic change, including those with a MET mutation. Crizotinib up-regulated the expression of BIM, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, and down-regulated that of survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, in cells with MET amplification. Forced depletion of BIM and expression of survivin each inhibited crizotinib-induced apoptosis, suggesting that both up-regulation of BIM and down-regulation of survivin contribute to the proapoptotic effect of crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Crizotinib shows a marked antitumor action in MET amplification-positive lung cancer cells but not in cells without MET amplification, including those with a MET mutation.	D	high	The study investigates the antitumor action of crizotinib using 'lung cancer cells' (in vitro) and 'tumor xenografts' (in vivo animal models).

BACKGROUND: KRAS codons 12 and 13 mutations predict resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) in metastatic colorectal cancer. Also, BRAF V600E mutation has been associated with resistance. Additional KRAS mutations are described in CRC. METHODS: We investigated the role of KRAS codons 61 and 146 and BRAF V600E mutations in predicting resistance to cetuximab plus irinotecan in a cohort of KRAS codons 12 and 13 wild-type patients. RESULTS: Among 87 KRAS codons 12 and 13 wild-type patients, KRAS codons 61 and 146 were mutated in 7 and 1 case, respectively. None of mutated patients responded vs 22 of 68 wild type (P=0.096). Eleven patients were not evaluable. KRAS mutations were associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS, HR: 0.46, P=0.028). None of 13 BRAF-mutated patients responded vs 24 of 74 BRAF wild type (P=0.016). BRAF mutation was associated with a trend towards shorter PFS (HR: 0.59, P=0.073). In the subgroup of BRAF wild-type patients, KRAS codons 61/146 mutations determined a lower response rate (0 vs 37%, P=0.047) and worse PFS (HR: 0.45, P=0.023). Patients bearing KRAS or BRAF mutations had poorer response rate (0 vs 37%, P=0.0005) and PFS (HR: 0.51, P=0.006) compared with KRAS and BRAF wild-type patients. CONCLUSION: Assessing KRAS codons 61/146 and BRAF V600E mutations might help optimising the selection of the candidate patients to receive anti-EGFR moAbs.	B	high	The study investigates the role of specific KRAS and BRAF mutations in predicting resistance to cetuximab plus irinotecan in a cohort of 87 human patients.

d12338c2-b4ba-5e11-82f6-a0aa63102124	D	Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) autocrine activation predicts sensitivity to MET inhibition in glioblastoma.	Because oncogene MET and EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are in clinical development against several types of cancer, including glioblastoma, it is important to identify predictive markers that indicate patient subgroups suitable for such therapies. We investigated in vivo glioblastoma models characterized by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) autocrine or paracrine activation, or by MET or EGFR amplification, for their susceptibility to MET inhibitors. HGF autocrine expression correlated with high phospho-MET levels in HGF autocrine cell lines, and these lines showed high sensitivity to MET inhibition in vivo. An HGF paracrine environment may enhance glioblastoma growth in vivo but did not indicate sensitivity to MET inhibition. EGFRvIII amplification predicted sensitivity to EGFR inhibition, but in the same tumor, increased copies of MET from gains of chromosome 7 did not result in increased MET activity and did not predict sensitivity to MET inhibitors. Thus, HGF autocrine glioblastoma bears an activated MET signaling pathway that may predict sensitivity to MET inhibitors. Moreover, serum HGF levels may serve as a biomarker for the presence of autocrine tumors and their responsiveness to MET therapeutics.	D	high	The abstract explicitly states that the study investigated 'in vivo glioblastoma models' and 'HGF autocrine cell lines,' which are preclinical models (in vivo and in vitro) and do not involve direct human patient data.
b544bd80-6b2f-5cfd-8cbf-ba9ab4ec7708	D	Ponatinib inhibits polyclonal drug-resistant KIT oncoproteins and shows therapeutic potential in heavily pretreated gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients.	PURPOSE: KIT is the major oncogenic driver of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib are approved therapies; however, efficacy is often limited by the acquisition of polyclonal secondary resistance mutations in KIT, with those located in the activation (A) loop (exons 17/18) being particularly problematic. Here, we explore the KIT-inhibitory activity of ponatinib in preclinical models and describe initial characterization of its activity in patients with GIST. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cellular and in vivo activities of ponatinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib against mutant KIT were evaluated using an accelerated mutagenesis assay and a panel of engineered and GIST-derived cell lines. The ponatinib-KIT costructure was also determined. The clinical activity of ponatinib was examined in three patients with GIST previously treated with all three FDA-approved agents. RESULTS: In engineered and GIST-derived cell lines, ponatinib potently inhibited KIT exon 11 primary mutants and a range of secondary mutants, including those within the A-loop. Ponatinib also induced regression in engineered and GIST-derived tumor models containing these secondary mutations. In a mutagenesis screen, 40 nmol/L ponatinib was sufficient to suppress outgrowth of all secondary mutants except V654A, which was suppressed at 80 nmol/L. This inhibitory profile could be rationalized on the basis of structural analyses. Ponatinib (30 mg daily) displayed encouraging clinical activity in two of three patients with GIST. CONCLUSION: Ponatinib possesses potent activity against most major clinically relevant KIT mutants and has demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity in patients with refractory GIST. These data strongly support further evaluation of ponatinib in patients with GIST.	C	high	The study includes preclinical evidence (in vitro and in vivo models) but also describes the clinical activity of ponatinib in three human patients. According to the CIViC evidence level definitions, a study with a very small patient series (<5 patients) falls under Level C (Case Study), which is a higher level of evidence than purely preclinical data (Level D).
62f24922-0cec-54cf-8c98-fd9501b5b01f	C	Dasatinib induces significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase.	Treatment options are limited for patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-AP). Dasatinib is a novel, potent, oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC-family kinases that showed marked efficacy in a phase 1 trial of patients with imatinib-resistant CML. Results are presented for 107 patients with CML-AP with imatinib-resistance or -intolerance from a phase 2, open-label study further evaluating dasatinib efficacy and safety. At 8 months' minimum follow-up, 81%, 64%, and 39% of patients achieved overall, major (MaHR), and complete hematologic responses, respectively, whereas 33% and 24% attained major and complete cytogenetic remission. Of 69 patients who achieved MaHR, 7 progressed. Seventy-six percent of patients are estimated to be alive and progression-free at 10 months. Response rates for the 60% of patients with baseline BCR-ABL mutations did not differ from the total population. Dasatinib was well tolerated: most nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate; no imatinib-intolerant patients discontinued dasatinib because of AEs. Although common (76% of patients with severe neutropenia), cytopenias were manageable through dose modification. In summary, dasatinib induced significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance, was well tolerated, and may represent a potent new therapeutic option for CML-AP. Further follow-up is warranted. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #CA180005.	B	high	The abstract describes a Phase 2, open-label clinical study involving 107 human patients, providing direct clinical evidence with statistical results on the efficacy and safety of dasatinib.

2fea0ef8-e110-5e89-8dd3-cd3224674529	B	Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition in melanoma with BRAF V600 mutations.	BACKGROUND: Resistance to therapy with BRAF kinase inhibitors is associated with reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. To address this problem, we conducted a phase 1 and 2 trial of combined treatment with dabrafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor. METHODS: In this open-label study involving 247 patients with metastatic melanoma and BRAF V600 mutations, we evaluated the pharmacokinetic activity and safety of oral dabrafenib (75 or 150 mg twice daily) and trametinib (1, 1.5, or 2 mg daily) in 85 patients and then randomly assigned 162 patients to receive combination therapy with dabrafenib (150 mg) plus trametinib (1 or 2 mg) or dabrafenib monotherapy. The primary end points were the incidence of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, survival free of melanoma progression, and response. Secondary end points were overall survival and pharmacokinetic activity. RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxic effects were infrequently observed in patients receiving combination therapy with 150 mg of dabrafenib and 2 mg of trametinib (combination 150/2). Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma was seen in 7% of patients receiving combination 150/2 and in 19% receiving monotherapy (P=0.09), whereas pyrexia was more common in the combination 150/2 group than in the monotherapy group (71% vs. 26%). Median progression-free survival in the combination 150/2 group was 9.4 months, as compared with 5.8 months in the monotherapy group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.62; P<0.001). The rate of complete or partial response with combination 150/2 therapy was 76%, as compared with 54% with monotherapy (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Dabrafenib and trametinib were safely combined at full monotherapy doses. The rate of pyrexia was increased with combination therapy, whereas the rate of proliferative skin lesions was nonsignificantly reduced. Progression-free survival was significantly improved.

6c3e6977-e6fa-59d0-b6ca-99a7945071b9	C	Clinicopathological characteristics of 11 NSCLC patients with EGFR-exon 20 mutations.	INTRODUCTION: The characteristics of different types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are not extensively studied. The distribution of EGFR mutations is known, with the most frequent in exon 19 (deletions) or exon 21 (point mutations). Aberrations in exon 18 or 20 are infrequently found. Point mutations in exon 20 confer resistance against tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), whereas the effect of the rare exon 20 insertions is, to a lesser extent, known. We present clinicopathological characteristics of patients with EGFR mutations in the four exons, with emphasis on exon 20 positive patients. METHODS: NSCLC patients who tested positively for EGFR mutations at the Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway in the period between May 2010 and February 2012 were selected. Clinical information was collected for mutated patients, and response information for patients with exon 20 insertions treated with TKI is reported. RESULTS: Of 119 patients with EGFR mutation, 62.2% were women. The median age was 66.0 years. The frequency of exon 18, 19, 20, and 21 was 7%, 45%, 7%, and 38%, respectively. Four patients (3.3%) had double mutations, and exon 20 was involved in three of these. Seven of 11 exon 20 positive patients were treated with TKI. All five single-mutated exon 20 positive TKI-treated patients had progressive disease at first evaluation, whereas both TKI-treated exon 20 involving double-mutated patients had partial response. CONCLUSION: Exon 20 mutations seem to confer insensitivity to TKI treatment.	B	high	The study is a retrospective analysis of primary patient data from 119 NSCLC patients, with a specific focus on 11 patients with EGFR-exon 20 mutations. It reports clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes for more than 5 patients (7 patients treated with TKI for exon 20 mutations), aligning with the definition of Level B for clinical evidence.
4faae03d-6047-5fee-85cd-6e524f2c21ee	D	Functional genomics identifies ABCC3 as a mediator of taxane resistance in HER2-amplified breast cancer.	Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with distinct molecular subtypes characterized by differential response to targeted and chemotherapeutic agents. Enhanced understanding of the genetic alterations characteristic of different subtypes is needed to pave the way for more personalized administration of therapeutic agents. We have taken a functional genomics approach using a well-characterized panel of breast cancer cell lines to identify putative biomarkers of resistance to antimitotic agents such as paclitaxel and monomethyl-auristatin-E (MMAE). In vitro studies revealed a striking difference in sensitivity to these agents between cell lines from different subtypes, with basal-like cell lines being significantly more sensitive to both agents than luminal or HER2-amplified cell lines. Genome-wide association studies using copy number data from Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism arrays identified amplification of the chromosome 17q21 region as being highly associated with resistance to both paclitaxel and MMAE. An unbiased approach consisting of RNA interference and high content analysis was used to show that amplification and concomitant overexpression of the gene encoding the ABCC3 drug transporter is responsible for conferring in vitro resistance to paclitaxel and MMAE. We also show that amplification of ABCC3 is present in primary breast tumors and that it occurs predominantly in HER2-amplified and luminal tumors, and we report on development of a specific fluorescence in situ hybridization assay that may have utility as a predictive biomarker of taxane resistance in breast cancer.	D	high	The study primarily uses in vitro models (breast cancer cell lines) to identify and validate ABCC3 as a mediator of taxane resistance. While it mentions the presence of ABCC3 amplification in primary breast tumors, this is an observational finding of prevalence and not a clinical trial demonstrating the predictive utility or clinical impact of this biomarker in human patients receiving treatment. The core mechanistic evidence for resistance is preclinical.
8ef7fb48-c4af-50ad-bafe-0ef6e8799b46	D	Smoothened variants explain the majority of drug resistance in basal cell carcinoma.	Advanced basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) frequently acquire resistance to Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors through unknown mechanisms. Here we identify SMO mutations in 50% (22 of 44) of resistant BCCs and show that these mutations maintain Hedgehog signaling in the presence of SMO inhibitors. Alterations include four ligand binding pocket mutations defining sites of inhibitor binding and four variants conferring constitutive activity and inhibitor resistance, illuminating pivotal residues that ensure receptor autoinhibition. In the presence of a SMO inhibitor, tumor cells containing either class of SMO mutants effectively outcompete cells containing the wild-type SMO. Finally, we show that both classes of SMO variants respond to aPKC-ι/λ or GLI2 inhibitors that operate downstream of SMO, setting the stage for the clinical use of GLI antagonists.	B	high	The study identifies SMO mutations in 22 out of 44 (50%) resistant basal cell carcinomas, which constitutes primary patient data from a cohort larger than 5 patients. This aligns with the definition of Clinical Evidence (Level B).
5a5e703b-2908-50bd-8dca-3618a4fb3ff1	C	PIK3CA mutations in colorectal cancer are associated with clinical resistance to EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies.	The monoclonal antibodies (moAb) panitumumab and cetuximab target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and have proven valuable for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). EGFR-mediated signaling involves two main intracellular cascades: on one side KRAS activates BRAF, which in turn triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinases. On the other, membrane localization of the lipid kinase PIK3CA counteracts PTEN and promotes AKT1 phosphorylation, thereby activating a parallel intracellular axis. Constitutive activation of KRAS bypasses the corresponding signaling cascade and, accordingly, patients with mCRC bearing KRAS mutations are clinically resistant to therapy with panitumumab or cetuximab. We hypothesized that mutations activating PIK3CA could also preclude responsiveness to EGFR-targeted moAbs through a similar mechanism. Here, we present the mutational analysis of PIK3CA and KRAS and evaluation of the PTEN protein status in a cohort of 110 patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR moAbs. We observed 15 (13.6%) PIK3CA and 32 (29.0%) KRAS mutations. PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with clinical resistance to panitumumab or cetuximab; none of the mutated patients achieved objective response (P = 0.038). When only KRAS wild-type tumors were analyzed, the statistical correlation was stronger (P = 0.016). Patients with PIK3CA mutations displayed a worse clinical outcome also in terms of progression-free survival (P = 0.035). Our data indicate that PIK3CA mutations can independently hamper the therapeutic response to panitumumab or cetuximab in mCRC. When the molecular status of the PIK3CA/PTEN and KRAS pathways are concomitantly ascertained, up to 70% of mCRC patients unlikely to respond to EGFR moAbs can be identified.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from a cohort of 110 patients, which is greater than 5 patients. It presents statistical results (P-values) demonstrating an association between PIK3CA mutations and clinical resistance to EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies in metastatic colorectal cancer. This aligns with the definition of Level B for clinical evidence from trials or primary patient data with statistical results, but less definitive than Level A.

BACKGROUND: Poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors target cancers with defects in homologous recombination repair by synthetic lethality. New therapies are needed to reduce recurrence in patients with <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> germline mutation-associated early breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized trial involving patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer with <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and high-risk clinicopathological factors who had received local treatment and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to 1 year of oral olaparib or placebo. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 1836 patients underwent randomization. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis with a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the 3-year invasive disease-free survival was 85.9% in the olaparib group and 77.1% in the placebo group (difference, 8.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5 to 13.0; hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.58; 99.5% CI, 0.41 to 0.82; P<0.001). The 3-year distant disease-free survival was 87.5% in the olaparib group and 80.4% in the placebo group (difference, 7.1 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.0 to 11.1; hazard ratio for distant disease or death, 0.57; 99.5% CI, 0.39 to 0.83; P<0.001). Olaparib was associated with fewer deaths than placebo (59 and 86, respectively) (hazard ratio, 0.68; 99% CI, 0.44 to 1.05; P = 0.02); however, the between-group difference was not significant at an interim-analysis boundary of a P value of less than 0.01. Safety data were consistent with known side effects of olaparib, with no excess serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with high-risk, HER2-negative early breast cancer and germline <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, adjuvant olaparib after completion of local treatment and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly longer survival free of invasive or distant disease than was placebo.

77bfb6e4-1804-5299-8f2d-5549fc7b670d	C	Primary and secondary kinase genotypes correlate with the biological and clinical activity of sunitinib in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor.	PURPOSE: Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) harbor mutant KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) kinases, which are imatinib targets. Sunitinib, which targets KIT, PDGFRs, and several other kinases, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with GIST after they experience imatinib failure. We evaluated the impact of primary and secondary kinase genotype on sunitinib activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor responses were assessed radiologically in a phase I/II trial of sunitinib in 97 patients with metastatic, imatinib-resistant/intolerant GIST. KIT/PDGFRA mutational status was determined for 78 patients by using tumor specimens obtained before and after prior imatinib therapy. Kinase mutants were biochemically profiled for sunitinib and imatinib sensitivity. RESULTS: Clinical benefit (partial response or stable disease for > or = 6 months) with sunitinib was observed for the three most common primary GIST genotypes: KIT exon 9 (58%), KIT exon 11 (34%), and wild-type KIT/PDGFRA (56%). Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer for patients with primary KIT exon 9 mutations (P = .0005) or with a wild-type genotype (P = .0356) than for those with KIT exon 11 mutations. The same pattern was observed for overall survival (OS). PFS and OS were longer for patients with secondary KIT exon 13 or 14 mutations (which involve the KIT-adenosine triphosphate binding pocket) than for those with exon 17 or 18 mutations (which involve the KIT activation loop). Biochemical profiling studies confirmed the clinical results. CONCLUSION: The clinical activity of sunitinib after imatinib failure is significantly influenced by both primary and secondary mutations in the predominant pathogenic kinases, which has implications for optimization of the treatment of patients with GIST.

4d23b9c8-961c-515a-8ead-b2b537e4375d	B	FOXP3 expression in cancer cells and anthracyclines efficacy in patients with primary breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy in the phase III UNICANCER-PACS 01 trial.	BACKGROUND: Predictive markers of response to chemotherapy are lacking in breast cancer patients. Forkhead Box Protein 3 (FOXP3) is an anti-oncogene whose absence in cancer cells could confer resistance to DNA damaging agent. So we made the hypothesis that FOXP3 expression predicts the response to anthracyclines in breast cancer patients and that adjuvant chemotherapy adding taxanes to anthracyclines confers an overall survival (OS) benefit over anthracyclines alone, in patients with FOXP3-negative tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression of FOXP3 in cancer cells was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in tumor samples from 1097 patients who participated in the PACS01 randomized trial that evaluated in adjuvant setting the adjunction of docetaxel (Taxotere) to anthracyclines in patients with localized breast cancer. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression model were used to assess OS according to the presence or absence of FOXP3 expression in tumor cells. RESULTS: Four hundred and five tumors were found to express FOXP3 (37%). FOXP3 expression in breast cancer cells was associated with better OS (P = 0.003). Uni- and multivariate survival analyses according to treatment arm revealed that FOXP3 expression in breast cancer cells is independently associated with improved OS in patients treated with anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy, but not in patients treated with sequential anthracycline-taxane. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that FOXP3 induction in breast cancer cell lines using histone deacetylase inhibitor enhances anthracyclines efficacy. CONCLUSION: FOXP3 expression in tumor cells may be an accurate predictive biomarker of anthracycline efficacy in breast cancer.

62b53d4b-65e0-5416-89cd-094c5de6be6c	D	The ALK inhibitor ceritinib overcomes crizotinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.	UNLABELLED: Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements invariably develop resistance to the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib. Herein, we report the first preclinical evaluation of the next-generation ALK TKI, ceritinib (LDK378), in the setting of crizotinib resistance. An interrogation of in vitro and in vivo models of acquired resistance to crizotinib, including cell lines established from biopsies of patients with crizotinib-resistant NSCLC, revealed that ceritinib potently overcomes crizotinib-resistant mutations. In particular, ceritinib effectively inhibits ALK harboring L1196M, G1269A, I1171T, and S1206Y mutations, and a cocrystal structure of ceritinib bound to ALK provides structural bases for this increased potency. However, we observed that ceritinib did not overcome two crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, G1202R and F1174C, and one of these mutations was identified in 5 of 11 biopsies from patients with acquired resistance to ceritinib. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease. SIGNIFICANCE: The second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib can overcome several crizotinib-resistant mutations and is potent against several in vitro and in vivo laboratory models of acquired resistance to crizotinib. These findings provide the molecular basis for the marked clinical activity of ceritinib in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with crizotinib-resistant disease.

Relapse is the leading cause of mortality in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Among chemotherapeutics, thiopurines are key drugs in ALL combination therapy. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified relapse-specific mutations in the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 gene (PRPS1), which encodes a rate-limiting purine biosynthesis enzyme, in 24/358 (6.7%) relapsed childhood B cell ALL (B-ALL) cases. All individuals who harbored PRPS1 mutations relapsed early during treatment, and mutated ALL clones expanded exponentially before clinical relapse. Our functional analyses of PRPS1 mutants uncovered a new chemotherapy-resistance mechanism involving reduced feedback inhibition of de novo purine biosynthesis and competitive inhibition of thiopurine activation. Notably, the de novo purine synthesis inhibitor lometrexol effectively abrogated PRPS1 mutant-driven drug resistance. These results highlight the importance of constitutive activation of the de novo purine synthesis pathway in thiopurine resistance, and they offer therapeutic strategies for the treatment of relapsed and thiopurine-resistant ALL.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from 24 individuals with relapsed childhood B-ALL, identifying specific mutations and their association with early relapse and drug resistance. This fits the definition of Level B, which includes primary patient data with more than 5 patients.

There are no effective therapies for the ~30% of human malignancies with mutant RAS oncogenes. Using a kinome-centered synthetic lethality screen, we find that suppression of the ERBB3 receptor tyrosine kinase sensitizes KRAS mutant lung and colon cancer cells to MEK inhibitors. We show that MEK inhibition results in MYC-dependent transcriptional upregulation of ERBB3, which is responsible for intrinsic drug resistance. Drugs targeting both EGFR and ERBB2, each capable of forming heterodimers with ERBB3, can reverse unresponsiveness to MEK inhibition by decreasing inhibitory phosphorylation of the proapoptotic proteins BAD and BIM. Moreover, ERBB3 protein level is a biomarker of response to combinatorial treatment. These data suggest a combination strategy for treating KRAS mutant colon and lung cancers and a way to identify the tumors that are most likely to benefit from such combinatorial treatment.	D	high	The abstract describes findings from experiments conducted on 'KRAS mutant lung and colon cancer cells' and details molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and sensitization. This indicates the use of in vitro or in vivo models, which falls under preclinical evidence.

PURPOSE: JNJ-42756493 is an orally administered pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This first-in-human study evaluates the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and defines the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of JNJ-42756493. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of JNJ-42756493 from 0.5 to 12 mg administered continuously daily or JNJ-42756493 10 or 12 mg administered intermittently (7 days on/7 days off). RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were enrolled. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included hyperphosphatemia (65%), asthenia (55%), dry mouth (45%), nail toxicity (35%), constipation (34%), decreased appetite (32%), and dysgeusia (31%). Twenty-seven patients (42%) experienced grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events, and one dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 ALT elevation was observed at 12 mg daily. Maximum-tolerated dose was not defined. Nine milligrams daily was considered as the initial RP2D; however, tolerability was improved with intermittent schedules, and 10 mg administered on a 7-days-on/7-days-off schedule was considered the final RP2D. Pharmacokinetics were linear, dose proportional, and predictable, with a half-life of 50 to 60 hours. Dose-dependent elevations in serum phosphate, a manifestation of pharmacodynamic effect, occurred in all patients starting at 4 mg daily. Among 23 response-evaluable patients with tumor FGFR pathway alterations, four confirmed responses and one unconfirmed partial response were observed in patients with glioblastoma and urothelial and endometrial cancer (all with FGFR2 or FGFR3 translocations); 16 patients had stable disease. CONCLUSION: JNJ-42756493 administered at 10 mg on a 7-days-on/7-days-off schedule achieved exposures at which clinical responses were observed, demonstrated pharmacodynamic biomarker activity, and had a manageable safety profile.	B	high	This is a Phase I clinical trial (first-in-human study) involving 65 patients with advanced solid tumors. It evaluates safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and defines a recommended phase II dose, reporting clinical outcomes and statistical results, which aligns with the definition of Level B evidence.

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women, and over two-thirds of cases express estrogen receptor-α (ER-α, encoded by ESR1). Through a prospective clinical sequencing program for advanced cancers, we enrolled 11 patients with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer. Whole-exome and transcriptome analysis showed that six cases harbored mutations of ESR1 affecting its ligand-binding domain (LBD), all of whom had been treated with anti-estrogens and estrogen deprivation therapies. A survey of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified four endometrial cancers with similar mutations of ESR1. The five new LBD-localized ESR1 mutations identified here (encoding p.Leu536Gln, p.Tyr537Ser, p.Tyr537Cys, p.Tyr537Asn and p.Asp538Gly) were shown to result in constitutive activity and continued responsiveness to anti-estrogen therapies in vitro. Taken together, these studies suggest that activating mutations in ESR1 are a key mechanism in acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer therapy.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from 11 patients enrolled in a prospective clinical sequencing program, which fits the definition of 'primary patient data with >5 patients' for Level B. While it also includes in vitro experiments, the direct human evidence from a cohort of more than 5 patients is the primary basis for the association.

PURPOSE: Clinical features of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, L858R, deletions in exon 19, T790M, and insertions in exon 20, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are well known. The clinical significance of other uncommon EGFR mutations, such as their association with the effectiveness of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), is not well understood. This study aimed to improve the understanding of these uncommon EGFR mutations of unknown clinical significance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Specimens from 1,261 patients were tested for EGFR mutations. We surveyed the clinical data and the effectiveness of gefitinib and erlotinib in NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. RESULTS: Of the 1,261 patients, 627 (49.8%) had EGFR mutations. This included 258 patients with deletions in exon 19, 260 patients with L858R, 25 patients with insertions or duplications in exon 20, 6 patients with de novo T790M, and 78 (12.4%) patients with uncommon mutations. Of the 78 patients, 62 received either gefitinib or erlotinib treatment. The response rate of TKIs treatment was 48.4%, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.0 months. Mutations on G719 and L861 composed a major part (28 of 62) of uncommon mutations, and were associated with a favorable effectiveness of EGFR TKIs (response rate, 57.1%; median PFS, 6.0 months). Mutations other than G719 and L861 led to a worse response to EGFR TKIs (response rate, 20.0%; median PFS, 1.6 months). CONCLUSIONS: Uncommon EGFR mutations constituted a distinct part of the whole group of EGFR mutations. Their composition was heterogeneous, and their associations with EGFR TKIs differed.	B	high	The study analyzes primary patient data from a cohort of 1,261 patients, with 62 patients receiving TKI treatment for uncommon EGFR mutations. It provides statistical results such as response rates and progression-free survival, which aligns with the definition of Level B for clinical evidence derived from patient data with more than 5 patients and statistical results, but not a definitive Phase III trial.

Larotrectinib can be effective in patients with ETV6-NTRK3–positive B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, inducing prolonged molecular remission. Single-agent tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment could be a valuable treatment option in subgroups of kinase fusion–positive ALL patients.	C	medium	The abstract describes direct clinical observations in 'patients' (plural), indicating human evidence. However, it lacks specific details such as the number of patients, trial phase, or explicit statistical results, which are typically found in larger clinical trials (Level B). The phrasing 'Larotrectinib can be effective' and 'inducing prolonged molecular remission' suggests findings from a limited number of cases or a very small patient series, which aligns with the definition of Level C.
8bf842af-7bbc-568d-bdad-fdb791c0e717	D	Activity of second-generation ALK inhibitors against crizotinib-resistant mutants in an NPM-ALK model compared to EML4-ALK.	Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in both solid and hematological tumors. About 80% of ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) cases are characterized by the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation, encoding for the aberrant fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK, whereas 5% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients carry the inv(2)(p21;p23) rearrangement, encoding for the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion. The ALK/c-MET/ROS inhibitor crizotinib successfully improved the treatment of ALK-driven diseases. However, several cases of resistance appeared in NSCLC patients, and ALK amino acid substitutions were identified as a leading cause of resistance to crizotinib. Second-generation ALK inhibitors have been developed in order to overcome crizotinib resistance. In this work, we profiled in vitro the activity of crizotinib, AP26113, ASP3026, alectinib, and ceritinib against six mutated forms of ALK associated with clinical resistance to crizotinib (C1156Y, L1196M, L1152R, G1202R, G1269A, and S1206Y) and provide a classification of mutants according to their level of sensitivity/resistance to the drugs. Since the biological activity of ALK mutations extends beyond the specific type of fusion, both NPM-ALK- and EML4-ALK-positive cellular models were used. Our data revealed that most mutants may be targeted by using different inhibitors. One relevant exception is represented by the G1202R substitution, which was highly resistant to all drugs (>10-fold increased IC50 compared to wild type) and may represent the most challenging mutation to overcome. These results provide a prediction of cross-resistance of known crizotinib-resistant mutations against all second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) clinically available, and therefore could be a useful tool to help clinicians in the management of crizotinib-resistance cases.	D	high	The study explicitly states that it 'profiled in vitro the activity' of inhibitors and used 'NPM-ALK- and EML4-ALK-positive cellular models'. This indicates preclinical evidence derived from in vitro models, which aligns with Level D.

PURPOSE: The class I phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K) plays a major role in proliferation and survival in a wide variety of human cancers. A key factor in successful development of drugs targeting this pathway is likely to be the identification of responsive patient populations with predictive diagnostic biomarkers. This study sought to identify candidate biomarkers of response to the selective PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used a large panel of breast cancer cell lines and in vivo xenograft models to identify candidate predictive biomarkers for a selective inhibitor of class I PI3K that is currently in clinical development. The approach involved pharmacogenomic profiling as well as analysis of gene expression data sets from cells profiled at baseline or after GDC-0941 treatment. RESULTS: We found that models harboring mutations in PIK3CA, amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or dual alterations in two pathway components were exquisitely sensitive to the antitumor effects of GDC-0941. We found that several models that do not harbor these alterations also showed sensitivity, suggesting a need for additional diagnostic markers. Gene expression studies identified a collection of genes whose expression was associated with in vitro sensitivity to GDC-0941, and expression of a subset of these genes was found to be intimately linked to signaling through the pathway. CONCLUSION: Pathway focused biomarkers and the gene expression signature described in this study may have utility in the identification of patients likely to benefit from therapy with a selective PI3K inhibitor.	D	high	The study explicitly states that it used 'a large panel of breast cancer cell lines and in vivo xenograft models' to identify candidate biomarkers. These are examples of in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, which fall under Level D evidence.
27bb8c28-1aef-5419-9fd7-6a907a04360b	A	Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibition in non-small-cell lung cancer.	BACKGROUND: Oncogenic fusion genes consisting of EML4 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are present in a subgroup of non-small-cell lung cancers, representing 2 to 7% of such tumors. We explored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting ALK in such tumors in an early-phase clinical trial of crizotinib (PF-02341066), an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK tyrosine kinase. METHODS: After screening tumor samples from approximately 1500 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer for the presence of ALK rearrangements, we identified 82 patients with advanced ALK-positive disease who were eligible for the clinical trial. Most of the patients had received previous treatment. These patients were enrolled in an expanded cohort study instituted after phase 1 dose escalation had established a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. Patients were assessed for adverse events and response to therapy. RESULTS: Patients with ALK rearrangements tended to be younger than those without the rearrangements, and most of the patients had little or no exposure to tobacco and had adenocarcinomas. At a mean treatment duration of 6.4 months, the overall response rate was 57% (47 of 82 patients, with 46 confirmed partial responses and 1 confirmed complete response); 27 patients (33%) had stable disease. A total of 63 of 82 patients (77%) were continuing to receive crizotinib at the time of data cutoff, and the estimated probability of 6-month progression-free survival was 72%, with no median for the study reached. The drug resulted in grade 1 or 2 (mild) gastrointestinal side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of ALK in lung tumors with the ALK rearrangement resulted in tumor shrinkage or stable disease in most patients.

aebae2b1-0795-59e1-8f2c-ff1a9a6bc36a	A	Pralsetinib for RET fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (ARROW): a multi-cohort, open-label, phase 1/2 study.	BACKGROUND: Oncogenic alterations in RET have been identified in multiple tumour types, including 1-2% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and antitumour activity of pralsetinib, a highly potent, oral, selective RET inhibitor, in patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC. METHODS: ARROW is a multi-cohort, open-label, phase 1/2 study done at 71 sites (community and academic cancer centres) in 13 countries (Belgium, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, and the USA). Patients aged 18 years or older with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours, including RET fusion-positive NSCLC, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 (later limited to 0-1 in a protocol amendment) were enrolled. In phase 2, patients received 400 mg once-daily oral pralsetinib, and could continue treatment until disease progression, intolerance, withdrawal of consent, or investigator decision. Phase 2 primary endpoints were overall response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1·1 and assessed by blinded independent central review) and safety. Tumour response was assessed in patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC and centrally adjudicated baseline measurable disease who had received platinum-based chemotherapy or were treatment-naive because they were ineligible for standard therapy. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03037385, and enrolment of patients with treatment-naive RET fusion-positive NSCLC was ongoing at the time of this interim analysis. FINDINGS: Of 233 patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC enrolled between March 17, 2017, and May 22, 2020 (data cutoff), 92 with previous platinum-based chemotherapy and 29 who were treatment-naive received pralsetinib before July 11, 2019 (efficacy enrolment cutoff); 87 previously treated patients and 27 treatment-naive patients had centrally adjudicated baseline measurable disease. Overall responses were recorded in 53 (61%; 95% CI 50-71) of 87 patients with previous platinum-based chemotherapy, including five (6%) patients with a complete response; and 19 (70%; 50-86) of 27 treatment-naive patients, including three (11%) with a complete response. In 233 patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC, common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (43 patients [18%]), hypertension (26 [11%]), and anaemia (24 [10%]); there were no treatment-related deaths in this population. INTERPRETATION: Pralsetinib is a new, well-tolerated, promising, once-daily oral treatment option for patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC. FUNDING: Blueprint Medicines.

Purpose This two-part, first-in-human study was initiated in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and the schedule, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of oral BGJ398, a selective FGFR1-3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Patients and Methods Adult patients were treated with escalating dosages of BGJ398 5 to 150 mg once daily or 50 mg twice daily continuously in 28-day cycles. During expansion at the MTD, patients with FGFR1-amplified squamous cell non-small-cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC; arm 1) or other solid tumors with FGFR genetic alterations (mutations/amplifications/fusions) received BGJ398 daily on a continuous schedule (arm 2), or on a 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule (arm 3). Results Data in 132 patients from the escalation and expansion arms are reported (May 15, 2015, cutoff). The MTD, 125 mg daily, was determined on the basis of dose-limiting toxicities in four patients (100 mg, grade 3 aminotransferase elevations [n = 1]; 125 mg, hyperphosphatemia [n = 1]; 150 mg, grade 1 corneal toxicity [n = 1] and grade 3 aminotransferase elevations [n = 1]). Common adverse events in patients treated at the MTD (n = 57) included hyperphosphatemia (82.5%), constipation (50.9%), decreased appetite (45.6%), and stomatitis (45.6%). A similar safety profile was observed using the 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule (RP2D). However, adverse event-related dose adjustments/interruptions were less frequent with the 3-weeks-on/1-week-off (50.0%) versus the continuous (73.7%) schedule. Antitumor activity (seven partial responses [six confirmed]) was demonstrated with BGJ398 doses ≥ 100 mg in patients with FGFR1-amplified sqNSCLC and FGFR3-mutant bladder/urothelial cancer. Conclusion BGJ398 at the MTD/RP2D had a tolerable and manageable safety profile and showed antitumor activity in several tumor types, including FGFR1-amplified sqNSCLC and FGFR3-mutant bladder/urothelial cancers.

Bosutinib, a dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, has shown potent activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this phase 1/2 study we evaluated bosutinib in patients with chronic phase imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study to determine the recommended starting dose for part 2; part 2 evaluated the efficacy and safety of bosutinib 500 mg once-daily dosing. The study enrolled 288 patients with imatinib-resistant (n = 200) or imatinib-intolerant (n = 88) CML and no other previous kinase inhibitor exposure. At 24 weeks, 31% of patients achieved major cytogenetic response (primary end point). After a median follow-up of 24.2 months, 86% of patients achieved complete hematologic remission, 53% had a major cytogenetic response (41% had a complete cytogenetic response), and 64% of those achieving complete cytogenetic response had a major molecular response. At 2 years, progression-free survival was 79%; overall survival at 2 years was 92%. Responses were seen across Bcr-Abl mutants, except T315I. Bosutinib exhibited an acceptable safety profile; the most common treatment-emergent adverse event was mild/moderate, typically self-limiting diarrhea. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic adverse events (> 2% of patients) included diarrhea (9%), rash (9%), and vomiting (3%). These data suggest bosutinib is effective and tolerable in patients with chronic phase imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML. This trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00261846.

8e01ff28-8350-5c0f-b1f6-5e15418e05c9	D	Molecular Changes Associated with Acquired Resistance to Crizotinib in ROS1-Rearranged Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	PURPOSE: Although ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is sensitive to crizotinib, development of resistance is inevitable. Here, we identified molecular alterations in crizotinib-resistant tumors from two NSCLC patients with the CD74-ROS1 rearrangement, and in HCC78 cells harboring SLC34A2-ROS1 that showed resistance to crizotinib (HCC78CR cells). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ROS1 kinase domain mutations were examined in fresh tumor tissues from two NSCLC patients and HCC78CR1-3 cells by direct sequencing. Ba/F3 cells expressing ROS1 secondary mutations were constructed to evaluate resistance to crizotinib. An upregulated pathway was identified using phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array, EGFR signaling antibody array, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Cell proliferation and ROS1 downstream signaling pathways were compared between HCC78 and HCC78CR1-3 cells. RESULTS: The ROS1 G2032R mutation was identified in crizotinib-resistant tumors from one patient. Furthermore, HCC78CR1 and CR2 cells harbored a novel ROS1 L2155S mutation (73.3% and 76.2%, respectively). ROS1 G2032R and L2155S mutations conferred resistance to crizotinib in Ba/F3 cells. Evidence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition with downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was observed in HCC78CR1-2 cells and in the other patient. RNA-seq and EGFR signaling antibody array revealed that the EGFR pathway was significantly upregulated in HCC78CR3 versus HCC78 cells. Cells with the ROS1 mutation and upregulated EGFR were sensitive to foretinib, an inhibitor of c-MET, VEGFR2, and ROS1 and irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors plus crizotinib, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular changes associated with acquired crizotinib resistance in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC are heterogeneous, including ROS1 tyrosine kinase mutations, EGFR activation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.	C	high	The study includes direct human evidence from two NSCLC patients, which falls under the definition of a 'very small patient series' (<5 patients) for Level C.

fec95c0c-3abf-5ef9-8e67-57666c8db999	C	Dasatinib treatment of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia: analysis of responses according to preexisting BCR-ABL mutations.	Dasatinib is a BCR-ABL inhibitor with 325-fold higher potency than imatinib against unmutated BCR-ABL in vitro. Imatinib failure is commonly caused by BCR-ABL mutations. Here, dasatinib efficacy was analyzed in patients recruited to phase 2/3 trials with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia with or without BCR-ABL mutations after prior imatinib. Among 1043 patients, 39% had a preexisting BCR-ABL mutation, including 48% of 805 patients with imatinib resistance or suboptimal response. Sixty-threedifferent BCR-ABL mutations affecting 49 amino acids were detected at baseline, with G250, M351, M244, and F359 most frequently affected. After 2 years of follow-up, dasatinib treatment of imatinib-resistant patients with or without a mutation resulted in notable response rates (complete cytogenetic response: 43% vs 47%) and durable progression-free survival (70% vs 80%). High response rates were achieved with different mutations except T315I, including highly imatinib-resistant mutations in the P-loop region. Impaired responses were observed with some mutations with a dasatinib median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) greater than 3nM; among patients with mutations with lower or unknown IC(50), efficacy was comparable with those with no mutation. Overall, dasatinib has durable efficacy in patients with or without BCR-ABL mutations. All trials were registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00123474, NCT00101660, and NCT00103844.

6ab3ae6c-9bba-593f-a5d4-c5c782cf75ca	D	Identifying the determinants of response to MDM2 inhibition.	Previous reports have provided evidence that p53 mutation is a strong negative predictor of response to MDM2 inhibitors. However, this correlation is not absolute, as many p53Mutant cell lines have been reported to respond to MDM2 inhibition, while many p53WT cell lines have been shown not to respond. To better understand the nature of these exceptions, we screened a panel of 260 cell lines and noted similar discrepancies. However, upon extensive curation of this panel, these apparent exceptions could be eliminated, revealing a perfect correlation between p53 mutational status and MDM2 inhibitor responsiveness. It has been suggested that the MDM2-amplified subset of p53WT tumors might be particularly sensitive to MDM2 inhibition. To facilitate clinical testing of this hypothesis, we identified a rationally derived copy number cutoff for assignment of functionally relevant MDM2 amplification. Applying this cutoff resulted in a pan-cancer MDM2 amplification rate far lower than previously published.

a68f3465-7a1b-57f2-aebc-a149683f1c47	D	Epidermal growth factor receptor activation in glioblastoma through novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain.	BACKGROUND: Protein tyrosine kinases are important regulators of cellular homeostasis with tightly controlled catalytic activity. Mutations in kinase-encoding genes can relieve the autoinhibitory constraints on kinase activity, can promote malignant transformation, and appear to be a major determinant of response to kinase inhibitor therapy. Missense mutations in the EGFR kinase domain, for example, have recently been identified in patients who showed clinical responses to EGFR kinase inhibitor therapy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Encouraged by the promising clinical activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors in treating glioblastoma in humans, we have sequenced the complete EGFR coding sequence in glioma tumor samples and cell lines. We identified novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain of EGFR in 13.6% (18/132) of glioblastomas and 12.5% (1/8) of glioblastoma cell lines. These EGFR mutations were associated with increased EGFR gene dosage and conferred anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity to NIH-3T3 cells. Cells transformed by expression of these EGFR mutants were sensitive to small-molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest extracellular missense mutations as a novel mechanism for oncogenic EGFR activation and may help identify patients who can benefit from EGFR kinase inhibitors for treatment of glioblastoma.	B	high	The study identified novel missense mutations in EGFR by sequencing 132 human glioblastoma tumor samples, which constitutes primary patient data with a sample size greater than 5 patients. While it also includes preclinical in vitro and in vivo experiments, the direct analysis of a significant cohort of human tumor samples places it at Level B.
20552556-799e-512a-b57b-17fe59a3e987	B	Parallel phase Ib studies of two schedules of buparlisib (BKM120) plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (q21 days or q28 days) for patients with advanced solid tumors.	PURPOSE: Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase I (PI3K) inhibition sensitizes a wide range of cancer cell lines to platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy. This phase I study combines buparlisib, a pan-class 1A PI3K inhibitor, with two schedules of carboplatin and paclitaxel for patients with advanced solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01297452). METHODS: There were two regimens: Group 1 received carboplatin AUC 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2), on day 1 of a 21-day cycle with pegfilgrastim support; Group 2 received carboplatin AUC 5 (day 1) and paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) (days 1, 8, and 15) on a 28-day cycle without growth factor support. In both groups, three dose levels of buparlisib were explored: 50, 80, and 100 mg/day. Primary endpoint was to identify recommended phase II doses of buparlisib in both groups. RESULTS: Thirty subjects enrolled, 16 in Group 1 and 14 in Group 2. The DLTs were elevated alkaline phosphatase (n = 1) and uncomplicated neutropenia (n = 2). The median numbers of cycles were 5 (Group 1) and 6 (Group 2). The MTDs for buparlisib were 100 mg/day in Group 1 and 80 mg/day in Group 2. Among 25 patients with measurable disease, the confirmed objective response rate was 20% (one complete response, four partial responses). Among three patients with known loss of PTEN expression, all derived clinical benefit from treatment. CONCLUSION: The addition of buparlisib to carboplatin + paclitaxel was well tolerated, and preliminary activity was notable against tumors with loss of PTEN expression.

BACKGROUND: Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC) is a recently described pathologic entity. We report the case of a patient with an initial diagnosis of salivary acinic cell carcinoma later reclassified as MASC after next-generation sequencing revealed an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This alteration was targeted with the pan-Trk inhibitor entrectinib (Ignyta), which possesses potent in vitro activity against cell lines containing various NTRK1/2/3 fusions. RESULTS: A dramatic and durable response was achieved with entrectinib in this patient, followed by acquired resistance that correlated with the appearance of a novel NTRK3 G623R mutation. Structural modeling predicts that this alteration sterically interferes with drug binding, correlating to decreased sensitivity to drug inhibition observed in cell-based assays. CONCLUSIONS: This first report of clinical activity with TrkC inhibition and the development of acquired resistance in an NTRK3-rearranged cancer emphasize the utility of comprehensive molecular profiling and targeted therapy for rare malignancies (NCT02097810).

Bosutinib, a dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, has shown potent activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this phase 1/2 study we evaluated bosutinib in patients with chronic phase imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study to determine the recommended starting dose for part 2; part 2 evaluated the efficacy and safety of bosutinib 500 mg once-daily dosing. The study enrolled 288 patients with imatinib-resistant (n = 200) or imatinib-intolerant (n = 88) CML and no other previous kinase inhibitor exposure. At 24 weeks, 31% of patients achieved major cytogenetic response (primary end point). After a median follow-up of 24.2 months, 86% of patients achieved complete hematologic remission, 53% had a major cytogenetic response (41% had a complete cytogenetic response), and 64% of those achieving complete cytogenetic response had a major molecular response. At 2 years, progression-free survival was 79%; overall survival at 2 years was 92%. Responses were seen across Bcr-Abl mutants, except T315I. Bosutinib exhibited an acceptable safety profile; the most common treatment-emergent adverse event was mild/moderate, typically self-limiting diarrhea. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic adverse events (> 2% of patients) included diarrhea (9%), rash (9%), and vomiting (3%). These data suggest bosutinib is effective and tolerable in patients with chronic phase imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML. This trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00261846.	B	high	The abstract describes a Phase 1/2 clinical trial involving 288 human patients.

5811b775-71cb-5ebd-9deb-a33321a5ea5f	D	Anti-tumor activity of motesanib in a medullary thyroid cancer model.	BACKGROUND: Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is frequently associated with mutations in the tyrosine kinase Ret and with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Motesanib is an investigational, orally administered small molecule antagonist of VEGFR1, 2, and 3; platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR); Kit; and possibly Ret. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of motesanib on wildtype and mutant Ret activity in vitro and on tumor xenograft growth in a mouse model of MTC. METHODS/RESULTS: In cellular phosphorylation assays, motesanib inhibited the activity of wild-type Ret (IC(50)=66 nM), while it had limited activity against mutant Ret C634W (IC(50)=1100 nM) or Ret M918T (IC(50)>2500 nM). In vivo, motesanib significantly inhibited the growth of TT tumor cell xenografts (expressing Ret C634W) and significantly reduced tumor blood vessel area and tumor cell proliferation, compared with control. Treatment with motesanib resulted in substantial inhibition of Ret tyrosine phosphorylation in TT xenografts and, at comparable doses, in equivalent inhibition of VEGFR2 phosphorylation in both TT xenografts and in mouse lung tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that motesanib inhibited thyroid tumor xenograft growth predominantly through inhibition of angiogenesis and possibly via a direct inhibition of VEGFR2 and Ret expressed on tumor cells. These data suggest that targeting angiogenesis pathways and specifically the VEGF pathway may represent a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of MTC.	D	high	The study investigates the effects of motesanib using in vitro cellular phosphorylation assays and in vivo mouse xenograft models (TT tumor cell xenografts). This constitutes preclinical evidence, as it does not involve human subjects.
31c7a2d2-6524-58de-b90e-73377263c7ca	C	<i>PIK3CA</i> Mutations Contribute to Acquired Cetuximab Resistance in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.	<b>Purpose:</b> Mutations in <i>KRAS</i> are considered to be the main drivers of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) blockade in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, the potential role of other genes downstream of the EGFR signaling pathway in conferring acquired resistance has not been extensively investigated.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients with mCRC and with acquired cetuximab resistance, we developed a targeted amplicon ultra-deep sequencing method to screen for low-abundance somatic mutations in a panel of genes that encode components of the EGFR signaling pathway. Mutations with significantly increased variant frequencies upon disease progression were selected by using quartile analysis. The functional consequences of the identified mutations were validated in cultured cells.<b>Results:</b> We analyzed 32 patients with acquired cetuximab resistance in a development cohort. Of them, seven (22%) carried five novel <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations, whereas eight (25%) carried previously reported <i>KRAS</i> mutations. Functional studies showed that novel <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations (all in exon 19; p.K944N, p.F930S, p.V955G, p.V955I, and p.K966E) promote cell viability in the presence of cetuximab. Only one novel <i>PIK3CA</i> mutation (p.K944N) was verified in one of the 27 patients with acquired resistance in a validation cohort, simultaneous <i>KRAS</i> and <i>PIK3CA</i> hotspot mutations were detected in two patients. Among the above 59 acquired resistance patients, those with <i>PIK3CA</i> or <i>RAS</i> mutations detected in ctDNA showed a pronounced decrease in progression-free survival than patients with no mutation.<b>Conclusions:</b> The <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations may potentially contribute to acquired cetuximab resistance in patients with mCRC. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(16); 4602-16. ©2017 AACR</i>.

Talazoparib inhibits PARP catalytic activity, trapping PARP1 on damaged DNA and causing cell death in <i>BRCA1/2</i>-mutated cells. We evaluated talazoparib therapy in this two-part, phase I, first-in-human trial. Antitumor activity, MTD, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of once-daily talazoparib were determined in an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study (NCT01286987). The MTD was 1.0 mg/day, with an elimination half-life of 50 hours. Treatment-related adverse events included fatigue (26/71 patients; 37%) and anemia (25/71 patients; 35%). Grade 3 to 4 adverse events included anemia (17/71 patients; 24%) and thrombocytopenia (13/71 patients; 18%). Sustained PARP inhibition was observed at doses ≥0.60 mg/day. At 1.0 mg/day, confirmed responses were observed in 7 of 14 (50%) and 5 of 12 (42%) patients with <i>BRCA</i> mutation-associated breast and ovarian cancers, respectively, and in patients with pancreatic and small cell lung cancer. Talazoparib demonstrated single-agent antitumor activity and was well tolerated in patients at the recommended dose of 1.0 mg/day.<b>Significance:</b> In this clinical trial, we show that talazoparib has single-agent antitumor activity and a tolerable safety profile. At its recommended phase II dose of 1.0 mg/day, confirmed responses were observed in patients with <i>BRCA</i> mutation-associated breast and ovarian cancers and in patients with pancreatic and small cell lung cancer. <i>Cancer Discov; 7(6); 620-9. ©2017 AACR.</i><i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 539</i>.

d11243da-4f8b-5e81-b368-4a95acc91e4b	D	Preclinical pharmacology of AZD5363, an inhibitor of AKT: pharmacodynamics, antitumor activity, and correlation of monotherapy activity with genetic background.	AKT is a key node in the most frequently deregulated signaling network in human cancer. AZD5363, a novel pyrrolopyrimidine-derived compound, inhibited all AKT isoforms with a potency of 10 nmol/L or less and inhibited phosphorylation of AKT substrates in cells with a potency of approximately 0.3 to 0.8 μmol/L. AZD5363 monotherapy inhibited the proliferation of 41 of 182 solid and hematologic tumor cell lines with a potency of 3 μmol/L or less. Cell lines derived from breast cancers showed the highest frequency of sensitivity. There was a significant relationship between the presence of PIK3CA and/or PTEN mutations and sensitivity to AZD5363 and between RAS mutations and resistance. Oral dosing of AZD5363 to nude mice caused dose- and time-dependent reduction of PRAS40, GSK3β, and S6 phosphorylation in BT474c xenografts (PRAS40 phosphorylation EC(50) ~ 0.1 μmol/L total plasma exposure), reversible increases in blood glucose concentrations, and dose-dependent decreases in 2[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) uptake in U87-MG xenografts. Chronic oral dosing of AZD5363 caused dose-dependent growth inhibition of xenografts derived from various tumor types, including HER2(+) breast cancer models that are resistant to trastuzumab. AZD5363 also significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of docetaxel, lapatinib, and trastuzumab in breast cancer xenografts. It is concluded that AZD5363 is a potent inhibitor of AKT with pharmacodynamic activity in vivo, has potential to treat a range of solid and hematologic tumors as monotherapy or a combinatorial agent, and has potential for personalized medicine based on the genetic status of PIK3CA, PTEN, and RAS. AZD5363 is currently in phase I clinical trials.	D	high	The abstract describes studies conducted using in vitro models (cell lines) and in vivo models (nude mice xenografts).

PURPOSE: We explored the potential clinical association between programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and driven gene status in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: We systemically searched through October 2015. Odd ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated to examine the association of PD-L1 expression with driven gene status. A random- or fixed-effects model was used. RESULTS: Nine studies were identified. KRAS-mutant tumors were more likely to be PD-L1 positive than KRAS-wild type tumors (51% vs 36%; OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.01-2.84; p = 0.045). In contrast, PD-L1 expression did not differ by EGFR (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.43-1.73; p = 0.675) or ALK (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.44-2.37; p = 0.954) status. In subgroup analysis, there was also no significant association between PD-L1 expression and EGFR status in term of the cut-offs or ethnicity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, NSCLC with KRAS mutations showed a trend for higher frequency of positive PD-L1 expression.

2d8b6f6b-7ce7-5605-9f5c-9bd0a00c4d07	D	Predictive biomarkers of sensitivity to the phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase inhibitor GDC-0941 in breast cancer preclinical models.	PURPOSE: The class I phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K) plays a major role in proliferation and survival in a wide variety of human cancers. A key factor in successful development of drugs targeting this pathway is likely to be the identification of responsive patient populations with predictive diagnostic biomarkers. This study sought to identify candidate biomarkers of response to the selective PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used a large panel of breast cancer cell lines and in vivo xenograft models to identify candidate predictive biomarkers for a selective inhibitor of class I PI3K that is currently in clinical development. The approach involved pharmacogenomic profiling as well as analysis of gene expression data sets from cells profiled at baseline or after GDC-0941 treatment. RESULTS: We found that models harboring mutations in PIK3CA, amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or dual alterations in two pathway components were exquisitely sensitive to the antitumor effects of GDC-0941. We found that several models that do not harbor these alterations also showed sensitivity, suggesting a need for additional diagnostic markers. Gene expression studies identified a collection of genes whose expression was associated with in vitro sensitivity to GDC-0941, and expression of a subset of these genes was found to be intimately linked to signaling through the pathway. CONCLUSION: Pathway focused biomarkers and the gene expression signature described in this study may have utility in the identification of patients likely to benefit from therapy with a selective PI3K inhibitor.

The clinical significance of low-frequent RAS pathway-mutated alleles and the optimal sensitivity cutoff value in the prediction of response to anti-EGFR therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the added value of genotyping an extended RAS panel using a robust nanofluidic digital PCR (dPCR) approach. A panel of 34 hotspots, including RAS (KRAS and NRAS exons 2/3/4) and BRAF (V600E), was analyzed in tumor FFPE samples from 102 mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy. dPCR was compared with conventional quantitative PCR (qPCR). Response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were correlated to the mutational status and the mutated allele fraction. Tumor response evaluations were not available in 9 patients and were excluded for response rate analysis. Twenty-two percent of patients were positive for one mutation with qPCR (mutated alleles ranged from 2.1% to 66.6%). Analysis by dPCR increased the number of positive patients to 47%. Mutated alleles for patients only detected by dPCR ranged from 0.04% to 10.8%. An inverse correlation between the fraction of mutated alleles and radiologic response was observed. ROC analysis showed that a fraction of 1% or higher of any mutated alleles offered the best predictive value for all combinations of RAS and BRAF analysis. In addition, this threshold also optimized prediction both PFS and OS. We conclude that mutation testing using an extended gene panel, including RAS and BRAF with a threshold of 1% improved prediction of response to anti-EGFR therapy.

UNLABELLED: In vitro, EGFR inhibition, combined with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, causes synergistic cytotoxicity for BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> metastatic colorectal cancer, further augmented by irinotecan. The safety and efficacy of vemurafenib, irinotecan, and cetuximab in BRAF-mutated malignancies are not defined. In this 3+3 phase I study, patients with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-advanced solid cancers received cetuximab and irinotecan with escalating doses of vemurafenib. Nineteen patients (18 with metastatic colorectal cancer and 1 with appendiceal cancer) were enrolled. Three patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities. The MTD of vemurafenib was 960 mg twice daily. Six of 17 evaluable patients (35%) achieved a radiographic response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria, consistent with in vivo models demonstrating tumor regressions with the triplet regimen. Median progression-free survival was 7.7 months. BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) trends correlated with radiographic changes, and acquired mutations from cfDNA in genes reactivating MAPK signaling were observed at progression.

9bceb435-d634-5255-8fb2-27cb6f43a5cd	D	MYD88 L265P somatic mutation in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.	BACKGROUND: Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is an incurable, IgM-secreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL). The underlying mutation in this disorder has not been delineated. METHODS: We performed whole-genome sequencing of bone marrow LPL cells in 30 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, with paired normal-tissue and tumor-tissue sequencing in 10 patients. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the findings in samples from an expanded cohort of patients with LPL, those with other B-cell disorders that have some of the same features as LPL, and healthy donors. RESULTS: Among the patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, a somatic variant (T→C) in LPL cells was identified at position 38182641 at 3p22.2 in the samples from all 10 patients with paired tissue samples and in 17 of 20 samples from patients with unpaired samples. This variant predicted an amino acid change (L265P) in MYD88, a mutation that triggers IRAK-mediated NF-κB signaling. Sanger sequencing identified MYD88 L265P in tumor samples from 49 of 54 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and in 3 of 3 patients with non-IgM-secreting LPL (91% of all patients with LPL). MYD88 L265P was absent in paired normal tissue samples from patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia or non-IgM LPL and in B cells from healthy donors and was absent or rarely expressed in samples from patients with multiple myeloma, marginal-zone lymphoma, or IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance. Inhibition of MYD88 signaling reduced IκBα and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, as well as NF-κB nuclear staining, in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia cells expressing MYD88 L265P. Somatic variants in ARID1A in 5 of 30 patients (17%), leading to a premature stop or frameshift, were also identified and were associated with an increased disease burden. In addition, 2 of 3 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia who had wild-type MYD88 had somatic variants in MLL2. CONCLUSIONS: MYD88 L265P is a commonly recurring mutation in patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia that can be useful in differentiating Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and non-IgM LPL from B-cell disorders that have some of the same features.

0bea8b8d-d7b2-5eab-92c7-7a58f814777b	C	Systemic and CNS activity of the RET inhibitor vandetanib combined with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in KIF5B-RET re-arranged non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastases.	In-frame fusion KIF5B (the-kinesin-family-5B-gene)-RET transcripts have been characterized in 1-2% of non-small cell lung cancers and are known oncogenic drivers. The RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor, vandetanib, suppresses fusion-induced, anchorage-independent growth activity. In vitro studies have shown that vandetanib is a high-affinity substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp1/Abcg2) but is not transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), limiting its blood-brain barrier penetration. A co-administration strategy to enhance the brain accumulation of vandetanib by modulating P-gp/Abcb1- and Bcrp1/Abcg2-mediated efflux with mTOR inhibitors, specifically everolimus, was shown to increase the blood-brain barrier penetration. We report the first bench-to-bedside evidence that RET inhibitor combined with an mTOR inhibitor is active against brain-metastatic RET-rearranged lung cancer and the first evidence of blood-brain barrier penetration. A 74-year-old female with progressive adenocarcinoma of the lung (wild-type EGFR and no ALK rearrangement) presented for therapy options. A deletion of 5'RET was revealed by FISH assay, indicating RET-gene rearrangement. Because of progressive disease in the brain, she was enrolled in a clinical trial with vandetanib and everolimus (NCT01582191). Comprehensive genomic profiling revealed fusion of KIF5B (the-kinesin-family-5B-gene) and RET, in addition to AKT2 gene amplification. After two cycles of therapy a repeat MRI brain showed a decrease in the intracranial disease burden and PET/CT showed systemic response as well. Interestingly, AKT2 amplification seen is a critical component of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, alterations of which has been associated with both de novo and acquired resistance to targeted therapy. The addition of everolimus may have both overcome the AKT2 amplification to produce a response in addition to its direct effects on the RET gene. Our case report forms the first evidence of blood-brain barrier penetration by vandetanib in combination with everolimus. Further research is required in this setting.

The relationship between mutations in these kinases and clinical response to imatinib was examined in a group of patients with advanced GIST. PATIENTS AND METHODS: GISTs from 127 patients enrolled onto a phase II clinical study of imatinib were examined for mutations of KIT or PDGFRA. Mutation types were correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: Activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA were found in 112 (88.2%) and six (4.7%) GISTs, respectively. Most KIT mutations involved exon 9 (n = 23) or exon 11 (n = 85). All KIT mutant isoforms, but only a subset of PDGFRA mutant isoforms, were sensitive to imatinib, in vitro. In patients with GISTs harboring exon 11 KIT mutations, the partial response rate (PR) was 83.5%, whereas patients with tumors containing an exon 9 KIT mutation or no detectable mutation of KIT or PDGFRA had PR rates of 47.8% (P =.0006) and 0.0% (P <.0001), respectively. Patients whose tumors contained exon 11 KIT mutations had a longer event-free and overall survival than those whose tumors expressed either exon 9 KIT mutations or had no detectable kinase mutation. CONCLUSION: Activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA are found in the vast majority of GISTs, and the mutational status of these oncoproteins is predictive of clinical response to imatinib. PDGFRA mutations can explain response and sensitivity to imatinib in some GISTs lacking KIT mutations.

2b58349b-9413-52f7-b5a4-9dae84d666d1	D	Novel mutations of androgen receptor: a possible mechanism of bicalutamide withdrawal syndrome.	Most prostate cancers (PCs) become resistant to combined androgen blockade therapy with surgical or medical castration and antiandrogens after several years. Some of these refractory PCs regress after discontinuation of antiandrogen administration [antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome (AWS)]. Although the molecular mechanisms of the AWS are not fully understood because of the lack of suitable experimental models, one hypothesis of the mechanism is mutation of androgen receptor (AR). However, bicalutamide, which has become the most prevalent pure antiandrogen, does not work as an agonist for any mutant AR detected thus far in PC. To elucidate the mechanisms of the AWS, we established and characterized novel LNCaP cell sublines, LNCaP-cxDs, which were generated in vitro by culturing androgen-dependent LNCaP-FGC human PC cells in androgen-depleted medium with bicalutamide to mimic the combined androgen blockade therapy. LNCaP-FGC cells did not grow at first, but they started to grow after 6-13 weeks of culture. Bicalutamide stimulated LNCaP-cxD cell growth and increased prostate-specific antigen secretion from LNCaP-cxD cells both in vitro and in vivo. Sequencing of AR transcripts revealed that the AR in LNCaP-cxD cells harbors a novel mutation in codon 741, TGG (tryptophan) to TGT (cysteine; W741C), or in codon 741, TGG to TTG (leucine; W741L), in the ligand-binding domain. Transactivation assays showed that bicalutamide worked as an agonist for both W741C and W741L mutant ARs. Importantly, another antiandrogen, hydroxyflutamide, worked as an antagonist for these mutant ARs. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that within only 6-13 weeks of in vitro exposure to bicalutamide, LNCaP-FGC cells, whose growth had initially been suppressed, came to use bicalutamide as an AR agonist via W741 AR mutation to survive. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that AR mutation is one possible mechanism of the AWS and suggest that flutamide might be effective as a second-line therapy for refractory PC previously treated with bicalutamide.	D	high	The study describes experiments conducted using LNCaP cell sublines in vitro and in vivo (likely xenograft models), which are preclinical models. It does not involve direct human patient data or clinical trials.
14eb4da2-65e1-5495-94f8-81494e180630	D	Comparison of imatinib mesylate, dasatinib (BMS-354825), and nilotinib (AMN107) in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-based mutagenesis screen: high efficacy of drug combinations.	BMS-354825 (dasatinib) and AMN107 (nilotinib) are potent alternate Abl inhibitors with activity against many imatinib mesylate-resistant BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutants, except T315I. We used N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-exposed Ba/F3-p210(BCR-ABL) cells to compare incidence and types of KD mutants emerging in the presence of imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, and nilotinib, alone and in dual combinations. Although ENU is expected to induce mutations in multiple proteins, resistant clones were almost exclusively BCR-ABL KD mutant at relevant concentrations of nilotinib and dasatinib, consistent with a central role of KD mutations for resistance to these drugs. Twenty different mutations were identified with imatinib mesylate, 10 with nilotinib (including only 1 novel mutation, E292V) and 9 with dasatinib. At intermediate drug levels the spectrum narrowed to F317V and T315I for dasatinib and Y253H, E255V, and T315I for nilotinib. Thus, cross-resistance is limited to T315I, which is also the only mutant isolated at drug concentrations equivalent to maximal achievable plasma trough levels. With drug combinations maximal suppression of resistant clone outgrowth was achieved at lower concentrations compared with single agents, suggesting that such combinations may be equipotent to higher-dose single agents. However, sequencing uniformly revealed T315I, consistent with the need for a T315I inhibitor, to completely block resistance.	D	high	The study was conducted using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-exposed Ba/F3-p210(BCR-ABL) cells, which are in vitro cell line models.

10d1d895-1e67-5e51-b9e9-674dcb33d16d	D	A genetic progression model of Braf(V600E)-induced intestinal tumorigenesis reveals targets for therapeutic intervention.	We show that BRAF(V600E) initiates an alternative pathway to colorectal cancer (CRC), which progresses through a hyperplasia/adenoma/carcinoma sequence. This pathway underlies significant subsets of CRCs with distinctive pathomorphologic/genetic/epidemiologic/clinical characteristics. Genetic and functional analyses in mice revealed a series of stage-specific molecular alterations driving different phases of tumor evolution and uncovered mechanisms underlying this stage specificity. We further demonstrate dose-dependent effects of oncogenic signaling, with physiologic Braf(V600E) expression being sufficient for hyperplasia induction, but later stage intensified Mapk-signaling driving both tumor progression and activation of intrinsic tumor suppression. Such phenomena explain, for example, the inability of p53 to restrain tumor initiation as well as its importance in invasiveness control, and the late stage specificity of its somatic mutation. Finally, systematic drug screening revealed sensitivity of this CRC subtype to targeted therapeutics, including Mek or combinatorial PI3K/Braf inhibition.	D	high	The study primarily uses genetic and functional analyses in mice models to investigate BRAF(V600E)-induced intestinal tumorigenesis and drug sensitivity. This constitutes preclinical evidence, as it is derived from in vivo models and not direct human evidence.

BACKGROUND: Targeting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is of increasing interest as a therapeutic strategy in many tumors. The aim of this study was to identify molecular markers associated with mTOR inhibitor activity in women with metastatic endometrial cancer. METHODS: Archival tumor samples were collected from 94 women with recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer who participated in 3 National Cancer Insitute of Canada Clinical Trials Group phase 2 trials investigating single-agent mTOR inhibitors: IND160A and IND160B (temsirolimus) and IND192 (ridaforolimus). Analyses included mutational profiling using the OncoCarta Panel version 1.0 and immunohistochemical expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) and stathmin, a marker of PI3K activation. Associations between biomarker results and clinical outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Mutations were found in 32 of 73 analyzed tumors, PIK3CA (21 patients) was the most common mutated gene. Co-mutations were seen in 8 tumors, most frequently KRAS and PIK3CA (4 cases). PTEN loss was observed in 46 of 85 samples analyzed and increased stathmin expression was observed in 15 of 65 analyzed samples. No correlation was observed between biomarkers and response or progression. In patients taking concurrent metformin, there was a trend toward lower progression, of 11.8% versus 32.5% (P = .14). CONCLUSIONS: No predictive biomarker or combination of biomarkers for mTOR inhibitor activity were identified in this study. Restriction and enrichment of study entry, especially based on archival tumor tissue, should be undertaken with caution in trials using these agents.	B	high	The study involves the analysis of archival tumor samples from 94 women who participated in three Phase 2 clinical trials.

PURPOSE: Two recent phase III trials, BOLERO-1 and BOLERO-3 (Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus), evaluated the addition of everolimus to trastuzumab and chemotherapy in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer. The current analysis aimed to identify biomarkers to predict the clinical efficacy of everolimus treatment. METHODS: Archival tumor samples from patients in BOLERO-1 and BOLERO-3 were analyzed using next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Biomarker data were available for 549 patients. PIK3CA activating mutations and PTEN loss were reported in 30% and 16% of BOLERO-1 samples and in 32% and 12% of BOLERO-3 samples, respectively. PI3K pathway was hyperactive (PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss and/or AKT1 mutation) in 47% of BOLERO-1 and 41% of BOLERO-3 samples. In both studies, differential progression-free survival (PFS) benefits of everolimus were consistently observed in patient subgroups defined by their PI3K pathway status. When analyzing combined data sets of both studies, everolimus was associated with a decreased hazard of progression in patients with PIK3CA mutations (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.00), PTEN loss (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.96), or hyperactive PI3K pathway (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.93). Patients with wild-type PIK3CA (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.46), normal PTEN (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.26), or normal PI3K pathway activity (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.62) did not derive PFS benefit from everolimus. CONCLUSION: This analysis, although exploratory, suggests that patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive advanced breast cancer having tumors with PIK3CA mutations, PTEN loss, or hyperactive PI3K pathway could derive PFS benefit from everolimus.	B	high	This publication is an exploratory biomarker analysis derived from two large Phase III clinical trials (BOLERO-1 and BOLERO-3), involving 549 patients. It presents statistical results (Hazard Ratios and 95% CIs) regarding the association between molecular alterations and everolimus efficacy. While based on Phase III data, the analysis itself is described as 'exploratory' and 'suggests' an association, indicating it is less definitive than a Level A 'validated association' or 'practice-changing evidence'. Thus, it fits the criteria for Level B, which includes clinical trials (Phase I-III) or primary patient data with statistical results but less definitive than Level A.
5366ada4-51c7-5295-937e-e35970e58ab5	D	P-glycoprotein Mediates Ceritinib Resistance in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase-rearranged Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.	The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene is observed in 3%-5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Crizotinib and ceritinib, a next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) active against crizotinib-refractory patients, are clinically available for the treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, and multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs are currently under clinical evaluation. These ALK-TKIs exhibit robust clinical activity in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients; however, the emergence of ALK-TKI resistance restricts the therapeutic effect. To date, various secondary mutations or bypass pathway activation-mediated resistance have been identified, but large parts of the resistance mechanism are yet to be identified. Here, we report the discovery of p-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) overexpression as a ceritinib resistance mechanism in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients. P-gp exported ceritinib and its overexpression conferred ceritinib and crizotinib resistance, but not to PF-06463922 or alectinib, which are next-generation ALK inhibitors. Knockdown of ABCB1 or P-gp inhibitors sensitizes the patient-derived cancer cells to ceritinib, in vitro and in vivo. P-gp overexpression was identified in three out of 11 cases with in ALK-rearranged crizotinib or ceritinib resistant NSCLC patients. Our study suggests that alectinib, PF-06463922, or P-gp inhibitor with ceritinib could overcome the ceritinib or crizotinib resistance mediated by P-gp overexpression.	B	high	The study reports primary patient data, identifying P-gp overexpression in 3 out of 11 ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients resistant to ceritinib or crizotinib. This falls under 'primary patient data with >5 patients' as defined for Level B.

Bosutinib, a dual Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has shown potent activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This phase 1/2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily bosutinib 500 mg in leukemia patients after resistance/intolerance to imatinib. The current analysis included 118 patients with chronic-phase CML who had been pretreated with imatinib followed by dasatinib and/or nilotinib, with a median follow-up of 28.5 months. In this subpopulation, major cytogenetic response was attained by 32% of patients; complete cytogenetic response was attained by 24%, including in one of 3 patients treated with 3 prior TKIs. Complete hematologic response was achieved/maintained in 73% of patients. On-treatment transformation to accelerated/blast phase occurred in 5 patients. At 2 years, Kaplan-Meier-estimated progression-free survival was 73% and estimated overall survival was 83%. Responses were seen across Bcr-Abl mutations, including those associated with dasatinib and nilotinib resistance, except T315I. Bosutinib had an acceptable safety profile; treatment-emergent adverse events were primarily manageable grade 1/2 gastrointestinal events and rash. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic adverse events (> 2% of patients) included diarrhea (8%) and rash (4%). Bosutinib may offer a new treatment option for patients with chronic-phase CML after treatment with multiple TKIs. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00261846.

8e01ff28-8350-5c0f-b1f6-5e15418e05c9	D	Molecular Changes Associated with Acquired Resistance to Crizotinib in ROS1-Rearranged Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	PURPOSE: Although ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is sensitive to crizotinib, development of resistance is inevitable. Here, we identified molecular alterations in crizotinib-resistant tumors from two NSCLC patients with the CD74-ROS1 rearrangement, and in HCC78 cells harboring SLC34A2-ROS1 that showed resistance to crizotinib (HCC78CR cells). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ROS1 kinase domain mutations were examined in fresh tumor tissues from two NSCLC patients and HCC78CR1-3 cells by direct sequencing. Ba/F3 cells expressing ROS1 secondary mutations were constructed to evaluate resistance to crizotinib. An upregulated pathway was identified using phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array, EGFR signaling antibody array, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Cell proliferation and ROS1 downstream signaling pathways were compared between HCC78 and HCC78CR1-3 cells. RESULTS: The ROS1 G2032R mutation was identified in crizotinib-resistant tumors from one patient. Furthermore, HCC78CR1 and CR2 cells harbored a novel ROS1 L2155S mutation (73.3% and 76.2%, respectively). ROS1 G2032R and L2155S mutations conferred resistance to crizotinib in Ba/F3 cells. Evidence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition with downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was observed in HCC78CR1-2 cells and in the other patient. RNA-seq and EGFR signaling antibody array revealed that the EGFR pathway was significantly upregulated in HCC78CR3 versus HCC78 cells. Cells with the ROS1 mutation and upregulated EGFR were sensitive to foretinib, an inhibitor of c-MET, VEGFR2, and ROS1 and irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors plus crizotinib, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular changes associated with acquired crizotinib resistance in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC are heterogeneous, including ROS1 tyrosine kinase mutations, EGFR activation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.	C	high	The study includes direct human evidence from two NSCLC patients, which falls under the definition of a 'very small patient series (<5 patients)'.

fec95c0c-3abf-5ef9-8e67-57666c8db999	B	Dasatinib treatment of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia: analysis of responses according to preexisting BCR-ABL mutations.	Dasatinib is a BCR-ABL inhibitor with 325-fold higher potency than imatinib against unmutated BCR-ABL in vitro. Imatinib failure is commonly caused by BCR-ABL mutations. Here, dasatinib efficacy was analyzed in patients recruited to phase 2/3 trials with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia with or without BCR-ABL mutations after prior imatinib. Among 1043 patients, 39% had a preexisting BCR-ABL mutation, including 48% of 805 patients with imatinib resistance or suboptimal response. Sixty-threedifferent BCR-ABL mutations affecting 49 amino acids were detected at baseline, with G250, M351, M244, and F359 most frequently affected. After 2 years of follow-up, dasatinib treatment of imatinib-resistant patients with or without a mutation resulted in notable response rates (complete cytogenetic response: 43% vs 47%) and durable progression-free survival (70% vs 80%). High response rates were achieved with different mutations except T315I, including highly imatinib-resistant mutations in the P-loop region. Impaired responses were observed with some mutations with a dasatinib median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) greater than 3nM; among patients with mutations with lower or unknown IC(50), efficacy was comparable with those with no mutation. Overall, dasatinib has durable efficacy in patients with or without BCR-ABL mutations. All trials were registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00123474, NCT00101660, and NCT00103844.

8e61d0f7-b1d0-57c3-8a7c-6885f1080133	D	Receptor tyrosine kinases exert dominant control over PI3K signaling in human KRAS mutant colorectal cancers.	Therapies inhibiting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are effective against some human cancers when they lead to simultaneous downregulation of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling. However, mutant KRAS has the capacity to directly activate ERK and PI3K signaling, and this is thought to underlie the resistance of KRAS mutant cancers to RTK inhibitors. Here, we have elucidated the molecular regulation of both the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling pathways in KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cells and identified combination therapies that lead to robust cancer cell apoptosis. KRAS knockdown using shRNA suppressed ERK signaling in all of the human KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cell lines examined. However, no decrease, and actually a modest increase, in AKT phosphorylation was often seen. By performing PI3K immunoprecipitations, we determined that RTKs, often IGF-IR, regulated PI3K signaling in the KRAS mutant cell lines. This conclusion was also supported by the observation that specific RTK inhibition led to marked suppression of PI3K signaling and biochemical assessment of patient specimens. Interestingly, combination of RTK and MEK inhibitors led to concomitant inhibition of PI3K and MEK signaling, marked growth suppression, and robust apoptosis of human KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro and upon xenografting in mice. These findings provide a framework for utilizing RTK inhibitors in the treatment of KRAS mutant colorectal cancers.	D	high	The study primarily utilizes in vitro models (human KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cell lines) and in vivo models (xenografting in mice) to investigate molecular mechanisms and test combination therapies. While 'biochemical assessment of patient specimens' is mentioned, it is presented as supportive evidence for findings in cell lines and does not describe a clinical trial or patient outcomes, thus falling under preclinical evidence.
1678457b-d6c8-596e-9da7-3873a211ebc0	B	AKT Inhibition in Solid Tumors With AKT1 Mutations.	Purpose AKT1 E17K mutations are oncogenic and occur in many cancers at a low prevalence. We performed a multihistology basket study of AZD5363, an ATP-competitive pan-AKT kinase inhibitor, to determine the preliminary activity of AKT inhibition in AKT-mutant cancers. Patients and Methods Fifty-eight patients with advanced solid tumors were treated. The primary end point was safety; secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Tumor biopsies and plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) were collected in the majority of patients to identify predictive biomarkers of response. Results In patients with AKT1 E17K-mutant tumors (n = 52) and a median of five lines of prior therapy, the median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 6.9 months), 6.6 months (95% CI, 1.5 to 8.3 months), and 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.1 to 12.8 months) in patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast, gynecologic, and other solid tumors, respectively. In an exploratory biomarker analysis, imbalance of the AKT1 E17K-mutant allele, most frequently caused by copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity targeting the wild-type allele, was associated with longer PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.41; P = .04), as was the presence of coincident PI3K pathway hotspot mutations (HR, 0.21; P = .045). Persistent declines in AKT1 E17K in cfDNA were associated with improved PFS (HR, 0.18; P = .004) and response ( P = .025). Responses were not restricted to patients with detectable AKT1 E17K in pretreatment cfDNA. The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events were hyperglycemia (24%), diarrhea (17%), and rash (15.5%). Conclusion This study provides the first clinical data that AKT1 E17K is a therapeutic target in human cancer. The genomic context of the AKT1 E17K mutation further conditioned response to AZD5363.	B	high	The abstract describes a multihistology basket study involving 58 patients with advanced solid tumors, with 52 patients having AKT1 E17K-mutant tumors.

BACKGROUND: The prognostic and predictive role of KRAS mutations in advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unclear. TAILOR prospectively assessed the prognostic and predictive value of KRAS mutations in NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib or docetaxel in second line. PATIENTS AND METHODS: NSCLC patients from 52 Italian hospitals were genotyped for KRAS and EGFR mutational status in two independent laboratories. Wild-type EGFR patients (N = 218) received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and were randomly allocated at progression to erlotinib or docetaxel. Overall survival (OS) according to KRAS mutational status was the primary end point. RESULTS: KRAS mutations were present in 23% of TAILOR randomized cases. The presence of a KRAS mutation did not adversely affect progression-free (PFS) or overall (OS) survival [hazard ratio (HR) PFS = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-1.41, P = 0.977; OS = 1.24, 95% CI 0.87-1.77, P = 0.233], nor influenced treatment outcome (test for interaction: OS P = 0.965; PFS P = 0.417). Patients randomized to docetaxel treatment experienced longer survival independently from the KRAS mutational status of their tumors (HR: mutated KRAS 0.81, 95% CI 0.45-1.47; wild-type KRAS 0.79, 95% CI 0.57-1.10). CONCLUSION: In TAILOR, KRAS was neither prognostic nor predictive of benefit for either docetaxel or erlotinib. Docetaxel remains superior independently from KRAS status for second-line treatment in EGFR wild-type advanced NSCLC patients. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00637910.

4a9a7469-2e77-5179-91a1-00fc5cd2bdb1	D	Potent activity of ponatinib (AP24534) in models of FLT3-driven acute myeloid leukemia and other hematologic malignancies.	Ponatinib (AP24534) is a novel multitargeted kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits native and mutant BCR-ABL at clinically achievable drug levels. Ponatinib also has in vitro inhibitory activity against a discrete set of kinases implicated in the pathogenesis of other hematologic malignancies, including FLT3, KIT, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), and platelet derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα). Here, using leukemic cell lines containing activated forms of each of these receptors, we show that ponatinib potently inhibits receptor phosphorylation and cellular proliferation with IC50 values comparable to those required for inhibition of BCR-ABL (0.3 to 20 nmol/L). The activity of ponatinib against the FLT3-ITD mutant, found in up to 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, was particularly notable. In MV4-11 (FLT3-ITD(+/+)) but not RS4;11 (FLT3-ITD(-/-)) AML cells, ponatinib inhibited FLT3 signaling and induced apoptosis at concentrations of less than 10 nmol/L. In an MV4-11 mouse xenograft model, once daily oral dosing of ponatinib led to a dose-dependent inhibition of signaling and tumor regression. Ponatinib inhibited viability of primary leukemic blasts from a FLT3-ITD positive AML patient (IC50 4 nmol/L) but not those isolated from 3 patients with AML expressing native FLT3. Overall, these results support the investigation of ponatinib in patients with FLT3-ITD-driven AML and other hematologic malignancies driven by KIT, FGFR1, or PDGFRα.	D	high	The study primarily presents preclinical evidence, utilizing leukemic cell lines (in vitro) and a mouse xenograft model (in vivo). While it mentions experiments on 'primary leukemic blasts from a FLT3-ITD positive AML patient', these are in vitro assays on patient-derived samples, not direct clinical evidence from patients treated with the drug. This aligns with the definition of Level D for preclinical evidence.

Purpose This two-part, first-in-human study was initiated in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and the schedule, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of oral BGJ398, a selective FGFR1-3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Patients and Methods Adult patients were treated with escalating dosages of BGJ398 5 to 150 mg once daily or 50 mg twice daily continuously in 28-day cycles. During expansion at the MTD, patients with FGFR1-amplified squamous cell non-small-cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC; arm 1) or other solid tumors with FGFR genetic alterations (mutations/amplifications/fusions) received BGJ398 daily on a continuous schedule (arm 2), or on a 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule (arm 3). Results Data in 132 patients from the escalation and expansion arms are reported (May 15, 2015, cutoff). The MTD, 125 mg daily, was determined on the basis of dose-limiting toxicities in four patients (100 mg, grade 3 aminotransferase elevations [n = 1]; 125 mg, hyperphosphatemia [n = 1]; 150 mg, grade 1 corneal toxicity [n = 1] and grade 3 aminotransferase elevations [n = 1]). Common adverse events in patients treated at the MTD (n = 57) included hyperphosphatemia (82.5%), constipation (50.9%), decreased appetite (45.6%), and stomatitis (45.6%). A similar safety profile was observed using the 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule (RP2D). However, adverse event-related dose adjustments/interruptions were less frequent with the 3-weeks-on/1-week-off (50.0%) versus the continuous (73.7%) schedule. Antitumor activity (seven partial responses [six confirmed]) was demonstrated with BGJ398 doses ≥ 100 mg in patients with FGFR1-amplified sqNSCLC and FGFR3-mutant bladder/urothelial cancer. Conclusion BGJ398 at the MTD/RP2D had a tolerable and manageable safety profile and showed antitumor activity in several tumor types, including FGFR1-amplified sqNSCLC and FGFR3-mutant bladder/urothelial cancers.	B	high	This is a global Phase I, dose-escalation and dose-expansion clinical study involving 132 patients. This directly aligns with the definition of Level B, which includes clinical trials (Phase I–III) or primary patient data with more than 5 patients and statistical results.
ae53905b-ef8b-5700-a76d-2d6bc389bae4	B	Germline and somatic mutations in homologous recombination genes predict platinum response and survival in ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal carcinomas.	PURPOSE: Hallmarks of germline BRCA1/2-associated ovarian carcinomas include chemosensitivity and improved survival. The therapeutic impact of somatic BRCA1/2 mutations and mutations in other homologous recombination DNA repair genes is uncertain. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using targeted capture and massively parallel genomic sequencing, we assessed 390 ovarian carcinomas for germline and somatic loss-of-function mutations in 30 genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, and 11 other genes in the homologous recombination pathway. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of ovarian carcinomas had a deleterious germline (24%) and/or somatic (9%) mutation in one or more of the 13 homologous recombination genes: BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK1, CHEK2, FAM175A, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D. Nonserous ovarian carcinomas had similar rates of homologous recombination mutations to serous carcinomas (28% vs. 31%, P = 0.6), including clear cell, endometrioid, and carcinosarcoma. The presence of germline and somatic homologous recombination mutations was highly predictive of primary platinum sensitivity (P = 0.0002) and improved overall survival (P = 0.0006), with a median overall survival of 66 months in germline homologous recombination mutation carriers, 59 months in cases with a somatic homologous recombination mutation, and 41 months for cases without a homologous recombination mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Germline or somatic mutations in homologous recombination genes are present in almost one third of ovarian carcinomas, including both serous and nonserous histologies. Somatic BRCA1/2 mutations and mutations in other homologous recombination genes have a similar positive impact on overall survival and platinum responsiveness as germline BRCA1/2 mutations. The similar rate of homologous recombination mutations in nonserous carcinomas supports their inclusion in PARP inhibitor clinical trials.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from a cohort of 390 ovarian carcinomas, assessing germline and somatic mutations and correlating them with clinical outcomes (platinum sensitivity and overall survival). It presents statistical results (P-values) from this human patient data, which aligns with the definition of Level B for clinical evidence.
86f2da29-a34e-5db9-b4e2-01fb0fadd89e	D	FLT3-ITD-TKD dual mutants associated with AML confer resistance to FLT3 PTK inhibitors and cytotoxic agents by overexpression of Bcl-x(L).	FLT3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) is constitutively activated in about 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and represents a disease-specific molecular marker. Although FLT3-LM (length mutation) and TKD (tyrosine kinase domain) mutations have been considered to be mutually exclusive, 1% to 2% of patients carry both mutations. However, the functional and clinical significance of this observation is unclear. We demonstrate that FLT3-ITD-TKD dual mutants induce drug resistance toward PTK inhibitors and cytotoxic agents in in vitro model systems. As molecular mechanisms of resistance, we found that FLT3-ITD-TKD mutants cause hyperactivation of STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-5), leading to upregulation of Bcl-x(L) and RAD51 and arrest in the G(2)M phase of the cell cycle. Overexpression of Bcl-x(L) was identified as the critical mediator of drug resistance and recapitulates the PTK inhibitor and daunorubicin-resistant phenotype in FLT3-ITD cells. The combination of rapamycin, a selective mTOR inhibitor, and FLT3 PTK inhibitors restored the drug sensitivity in FLT3 dual mutant-expressing cells. Our data provide the molecular basis for understanding clinical FLT3 PTK inhibitor resistance and point to therapeutical strategies to overcome drug resistance in patients with AML.	D	high	The abstract explicitly states that the findings are based on 'in vitro model systems' and experiments conducted 'in FLT3-ITD cells' and 'FLT3 dual mutant-expressing cells'.

Peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare and sometimes lethal malignancy that presents a clinical challenge for both diagnosis and management. Recent studies have led to a better understanding of the molecular biology of peritoneal mesothelioma. Translation of the emerging data into better treatments and outcome is needed. From two patients with peritoneal mesothelioma, we derived whole genome sequences, RNA expression profiles, and targeted deep sequencing data. Molecular data were made available for translation into a clinical treatment plan. Treatment responses and outcomes were later examined in the context of molecular findings. Molecular studies presented here provide the first reported whole genome sequences of peritoneal mesothelioma. Mutations in known mesothelioma-related genes NF2, CDKN2A, LATS2, amongst others, were identified. Activation of MET-related signaling pathways was demonstrated in both cases. A hypermutated phenotype was observed in one case (434 vs. 18 single nucleotide variants) and was associated with a favourable outcome despite sarcomatoid histology and multifocal disease. This study represents the first report of whole genome analyses of peritoneal mesothelioma, a key step in the understanding and treatment of this disease.	C	high	The study describes clinical experience and molecular findings from 'two patients' with peritoneal mesothelioma.

54b1b0ff-25f1-50fd-bc07-843977c336ea	A	Encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib or encorafenib in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma (COLUMBUS): a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial.	BACKGROUND: Combined BRAF-MEK inhibitor therapy is the standard of care for BRAF<sup>V600</sup>-mutant advanced melanoma. We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor with unique target-binding properties, alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, versus vemurafenib in patients with advanced BRAF<sup>V600</sup>-mutant melanoma. METHODS: COLUMBUS was conducted as a two-part, randomised, open-label phase 3 study at 162 hospitals in 28 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically confirmed locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma; a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> or BRAF<sup>V600K</sup> mutation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; and were treatment naive or had progressed on or after previous first-line immunotherapy. In part 1 of the study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via interactive response technology to receive either oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus oral binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (encorafenib plus binimetinib group), oral encorafenib 300 mg once daily (encorafenib group), or oral vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (vemurafenib group). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded independent central review for encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib. Efficacy analyses were by intention-to-treat. Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug and one postbaseline safety assessment. The results of part 2 will be published separately. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01909453, and EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38. FINDINGS: Between Dec 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 577 of 1345 screened patients were randomly assigned to either the encorafenib plus binimetinib group (n=192), the encorafenib group (n=194), or the vemurafenib group (n=191). With a median follow-up of 16·6 months (95% CI 14·8-16·9), median progression-free survival was 14·9 months (95% CI 11·0-18·5) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group and 7·3 months (5·6-8·2) in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·54, 95% CI 0·41-0·71; two-sided p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events seen in more than 5% of patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were increased γ-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]); in the encorafenib group they were palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients), myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]); and in the vemurafenib group it was arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients). There were no treatment-related deaths except for one death in the combination group, which was considered possibly related to treatment by the investigator. INTERPRETATION: Encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib monotherapy showed favourable efficacy compared with vemurafenib. Overall, encorafenib plus binimetinib appears to have an improved tolerability profile compared with encorafenib or vemurafenib. Encorafenib plus binimetinib could represent a new treatment option for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. FUNDING: Array BioPharma, Novartis.

2d8b6f6b-7ce7-5605-9f5c-9bd0a00c4d07	D	Predictive biomarkers of sensitivity to the phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase inhibitor GDC-0941 in breast cancer preclinical models.	PURPOSE: The class I phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K) plays a major role in proliferation and survival in a wide variety of human cancers. A key factor in successful development of drugs targeting this pathway is likely to be the identification of responsive patient populations with predictive diagnostic biomarkers. This study sought to identify candidate biomarkers of response to the selective PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used a large panel of breast cancer cell lines and in vivo xenograft models to identify candidate predictive biomarkers for a selective inhibitor of class I PI3K that is currently in clinical development. The approach involved pharmacogenomic profiling as well as analysis of gene expression data sets from cells profiled at baseline or after GDC-0941 treatment. RESULTS: We found that models harboring mutations in PIK3CA, amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or dual alterations in two pathway components were exquisitely sensitive to the antitumor effects of GDC-0941. We found that several models that do not harbor these alterations also showed sensitivity, suggesting a need for additional diagnostic markers. Gene expression studies identified a collection of genes whose expression was associated with in vitro sensitivity to GDC-0941, and expression of a subset of these genes was found to be intimately linked to signaling through the pathway. CONCLUSION: Pathway focused biomarkers and the gene expression signature described in this study may have utility in the identification of patients likely to benefit from therapy with a selective PI3K inhibitor.	D	high	The study explicitly states that it used 'breast cancer cell lines and in vivo xenograft models' to identify candidate predictive biomarkers.

5368513f-89a2-5df7-86f1-5674af352341	D	A novel tankyrase small-molecule inhibitor suppresses APC mutation-driven colorectal tumor growth.	Most colorectal cancers (CRC) are initiated by mutations of APC, leading to increased β-catenin-mediated signaling. However, continued requirement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling for tumor progression in the context of acquired KRAS and other mutations is less well-established. To attenuate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in tumors, we have developed potent and specific small-molecule tankyrase inhibitors, G007-LK and G244-LM, that reduce Wnt/β-catenin signaling by preventing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation-dependent AXIN degradation, thereby promoting β-catenin destabilization. We show that novel tankyrase inhibitors completely block ligand-driven Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cell culture and display approximately 50% inhibition of APC mutation-driven signaling in most CRC cell lines. It was previously unknown whether the level of AXIN protein stabilization by tankyrase inhibition is sufficient to impact tumor growth in the absence of normal APC activity. Compound G007-LK displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties and inhibits in vivo tumor growth in a subset of APC-mutant CRC xenograft models. In the xenograft model most sensitive to tankyrase inhibitor, COLO-320DM, G007-LK inhibits cell-cycle progression, reduces colony formation, and induces differentiation, suggesting that β-catenin-dependent maintenance of an undifferentiated state may be blocked by tankyrase inhibition. The full potential of the antitumor activity of G007-LK may be limited by intestinal toxicity associated with inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and cell proliferation in intestinal crypts. These results establish proof-of-concept antitumor efficacy for tankyrase inhibitors in APC-mutant CRC models and uncover potential diagnostic and safety concerns to be overcome as tankyrase inhibitors are advanced into the clinic.	D	high	The study describes experiments conducted in cell culture, CRC cell lines, and APC-mutant CRC xenograft models (in vivo mouse models). These are all preclinical models and do not involve direct human evidence.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) carries an unfavorable prognosis and requires new treatment strategies. The associated t(11:14) translocation results in enhanced cyclin D1 expression and cyclin D1-dependent kinase activity to promote cell-cycle progression. A pharmacodynamic study of the selective CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991 was conducted in 17 patients with relapsed disease, using 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) and 3-deoxy-3[(18)F]fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) to study tumor metabolism and proliferation, respectively, in concert with pre- and on-treatment lymph node biopsies to assess retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation and markers of proliferation and apoptosis. Substantial reductions in the summed FLT-PET maximal standard uptake value (SUV(max)), as well as in Rb phosphorylation and Ki-67 expression, occurred after 3 weeks in most patients, with significant correlations among these end points. Five patients achieved progression-free survival time of > 1 year (range, 14.9-30.1+ months), with 1 complete and 2 partial responses (18% objective response rate; 90% confidence interval, 5%-40%). These patients demonstrated > 70%, > 90%, and ≥ 87.5% reductions in summed FLT SUV(max) and expression of phospho-Rb and Ki67, respectively, parameters necessary but not sufficient for long-term disease control. The results of the present study confirm CDK4/6 inhibition by PD0332991 at a well-tolerated dose and schedule and suggest clinical benefit in a subset of MCL patients.

The prognosis of metastatic pancreatic cancer remains poor despite recent advances in treatment with multidrug chemotherapy regimens. Use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and molecular targeted therapies has so far been disappointing. This report describes a patient with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) whose tumor was characterized by an activating mutation in exon 19 of the epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR</i>). He experienced response to erlotinib for 10 months, and then developed disease progression in association with emergence of the <i>T790M</i> mutation. Activating <i>EGFR</i> mutations in cancers other than lung are uncommon, but when present may predict response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Development of the <i>T790M</i> mutation in this case suggests that EGFR-targeted TKIs may follow similar patterns of resistance regardless of tumor type. Although actionable mutations are detected infrequently in PDAC, this case illustrates the potential benefit of offering genomic analysis to all patients with advanced disease.

0f09f3d0-ef72-553f-9af1-283bf8961929	A	Afatinib: first global approval.	Afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family of tyrosine kinases, is under development with Boehringer Ingelheim for the once-daily, oral treatment of cancer. Afatinib downregulates ErbB signalling by covalently binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 and HER4, irreversibly inhibiting tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation. It also inhibits transphosphorylation of HER3. Oral afatinib (Gilotrif™) has been approved in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have tumours with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations as detected by a US FDA-approved test. Afatinib has also been approved in Taiwan for the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. In addition, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has recommended the approval of afatinib (Giotrif®) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations who are EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor naïve. Afatinib is also under regulatory review in Canada, Japan and other Asian countries. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of afatinib, leading to this first approval in patients with metastatic NSCLC.

51e76a54-0d86-5172-a141-ced6ea059f1e	D	In vitro anticancer activity of PI3K alpha selective inhibitor BYL719 in head and neck cancer.	BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the present study was to explore the antiproliferative effect of BYL719, a specific inhibitor for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) p110α, in human head and neck cancer cell lines, as a single agent or in combination with the irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dacomitinib. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six head and neck cancer cell lines consisting of two PIK3CA mutant cell lines, SNU-1076 and Detroit562, and four PIK3CA wild-type cell lines, SNU-1066, SNU-1041, FaDu and SCC25, were analyzed. RESULTS: The PIK3CA-mutant cell lines were more sensitive to BYL719 than the PIK3CA wild-type cell lines. Following BYL719 treatment, all PIK3CA wild-type cell lines, except for the SNU-1066 cell line, exhibited higher IC50 values compared to the PIK3CA mutant cell lines. Administration of BYL719 induced cell cycle G0/G1 arrest and resulted in increased apoptosis in a dose-dependant manner. Furthermore, the administration of BYL719 reduced the level of p-mTOR, p-AKT and p-S6 expression indicating the down-regulation of downstream signaling. CONCLUSION: BYL719, a PI3K alpha selective blocker, could be a promising factor in the treatment of head and neck cancer either as a single agent or in combination with dacomitinib.	D	high	The study investigates the anticancer activity of BYL719 using human head and neck cancer cell lines, which constitutes an in vitro model.

c76b34d3-70f9-549e-93cc-399b7e1d9ac4	B	Evaluation of the association of PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss with efficacy of trastuzumab therapy in metastatic breast cancer.	Trastuzumab (T) is effective in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with HER2 overexpression and/or amplification, but resistance to T develops in a significant number of HER2-positive patients. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance is critical to the care of these patients. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were collected from 256 patients with T-treated MBC. Clinical information was collected retrospectively from the patients' medical records. Central review of HER2 status by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that of the 227 eligible patients only 139 (61%) were truly HER2-positive. PTEN, ER, PgR, and Ki67 were evaluated by IHC, while PTEN status was evaluated by FISH as well. PIK3CA mutations were identified with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Median time to progression (TTP) was 14.4 months for the HER2-positive and 10.3 for the HER2-negative patients (log-rank, P = 0.22). Survival from the initiation of T (survivalT) was 50.4 months for the HER2-positive and 35.3 for the HER2-negative subgroups (P = 0.006). Higher risk of progression was associated with HER2-positive status and the presence of PIK3CA mutations (P = 0.014). PTEN loss, as determined by IHC, was associated with lower survivalT in the whole population (P = 0.029) and in the HER2-positive population (P = 0.017). PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss status were evaluated together as a single parameter, to estimate the impact of activation of the PI3K/AKT molecular pathway, and it was significantly associated with both decreased TTP (P = 0.003 in the total population, P = 0.004 in HER2-positive patients) and survival (survivalT, P = 0.011 in total, P = 0.006 in HER2-positive). In this trastuzumab-treated breast cancer population, PIK3CA activating mutations were associated with shorter TTP and PTEN loss with decreased survival. The activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway from either defect was associated with both TTP and survival, indicating the adverse effect of this pathway's status on trastuzumab efficacy.	B	high	This study is a retrospective analysis of primary patient data from 256 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab.

2f6e4948-24b9-5574-9b79-8c180e675f35	C	Recurrent BRAF kinase fusions in melanocytic tumors offer an opportunity for targeted therapy.	BRAF is the most prevalent oncogene and an important therapeutic target in melanoma. In some cancers, BRAF is activated by rearrangements that fuse its kinase domain to 5' partner genes. We examined 848 comparative genomic hybridization profiles of melanocytic tumors and found copy number transitions within BRAF in 10 tumors, of which six could be further characterized by sequencing. In all, the BRAF kinase domain was fused in-frame to six N-terminal partners. No other mutations were identified in melanoma oncogenes. One of the seven melanoma cell lines without known oncogenic mutations harbored a similar BRAF fusion, which constitutively activated the MAP kinase pathway. Sorafenib, but not vemurafenib, could block MAP kinase pathway activation and proliferation of the cell line at clinically relevant concentrations, whereas BRAF(V) (600E) mutant melanoma cell lines were significantly more sensitive to vemurafenib. The patient from whom the cell line was derived showed a durable clinical response to sorafenib.	B	high	The study identifies recurrent BRAF kinase fusions in 10 human melanocytic tumors, which constitutes primary patient data with more than 5 patients.

METHODS: Patients received cabozantinib 100 mg daily during a 12-week lead-in. Patients with stable disease (SD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) at week 12 were randomised to cabozantinib or placebo. Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) at week 12 and postrandomisation progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were enroled (62% cutaneous, 30% uveal, and 8% mucosal). At week 12, the ORR was 5%; 39% of patients had SD. During the lead-in phase, reduction in target lesions from baseline was seen in 55% of evaluable patients overall and in 59% of evaluable patients with uveal melanoma. Median PFS after randomisation was 4.1 months with cabozantinib and 2.8 months with placebo (hazard ratio of 0.59; P=0.284). Median PFS from study day 1 was 3.8 months, 6-month PFS was 33%, and median overall survival was 9.4 months. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were fatigue (14%), hypertension (10%), and abdominal pain (8%). One treatment-related death was reported from peritonitis due to diverticular perforation. CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib has clinical activity in patients with metastatic melanoma, including uveal melanoma. Further clinical investigation is warranted.

b0ab2d19-352b-56d4-8554-41ae694e375e	D	Inhibitor-sensitive FGFR1 amplification in human non-small cell lung cancer.	BACKGROUND: Squamous cell lung carcinomas account for approximately 25% of new lung carcinoma cases and 40,000 deaths per year in the United States. Although there are multiple genomically targeted therapies for lung adenocarcinoma, none has yet been reported in squamous cell lung carcinoma. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using SNP array analysis, we found that a region of chromosome segment 8p11-12 containing three genes-WHSC1L1, LETM2, and FGFR1-is amplified in 3% of lung adenocarcinomas and 21% of squamous cell lung carcinomas. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line harboring focal amplification of FGFR1 is dependent on FGFR1 activity for cell growth, as treatment of this cell line either with FGFR1-specific shRNAs or with FGFR small molecule enzymatic inhibitors leads to cell growth inhibition. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These studies show that FGFR1 amplification is common in squamous cell lung cancer, and that FGFR1 may represent a promising therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data through SNP array analysis, identifying FGFR1 amplification in human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell lung carcinomas. The reported percentages (3% and 21%) imply a cohort of more than 5 patients, which aligns with the definition of Level B for 'primary patient data with >5 patients'. While the functional validation of FGFR1 dependency and inhibitor sensitivity is performed in cell lines (Level D evidence), the initial discovery and prevalence in human tumors elevate the overall evidence level beyond purely preclinical research.
850b0f70-6c4b-5cc0-af2f-07d0b05b07da	B	Safety and efficacy of vemurafenib in BRAF(V600E) and BRAF(V600K) mutation-positive melanoma (BRIM-3): extended follow-up of a phase 3, randomised, open-label study.	BACKGROUND: In the BRIM-3 trial, vemurafenib was associated with risk reduction versus dacarbazine of both death and progression in patients with advanced BRAF(V600) mutation-positive melanoma. We present an extended follow-up analysis of the total population and in the BRAF(V600E) and BRAF(V600K) mutation subgroups. METHODS: Patients older than 18 years, with treatment-naive metastatic melanoma and whose tumour tissue was positive for BRAF(V600) mutations were eligible. Patients also had to have a life expectancy of at least 3 months, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function. Patients were randomly assigned by interactive voice recognition system to receive either vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) or dacarbazine (1000 mg/m(2) of body surface area intravenously every 3 weeks). Coprimary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population (n=675), with data censored at crossover. A sensitivity analysis was done. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01006980. FINDINGS: 675 eligible patients were enrolled from 104 centres in 12 countries between Jan 4, 2010, and Dec 16, 2010. 337 patients were randomly assigned to receive vemurafenib and 338 to receive dacarbazine. Median follow-up was 12·5 months (IQR 7·7-16·0) on vemurafenib and 9·5 months (3·1-14·7) on dacarbazine. 83 (25%) of the 338 patients initially randomly assigned to dacarbazine crossed over from dacarbazine to vemurafenib. Median overall survival was significantly longer in the vemurafenib group than in the dacarbazine group (13·6 months [95% CI 12·0-15·2] vs 9·7 months [7·9-12·8]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·70 [95% CI 0·57-0·87]; p=0·0008), as was median progression-free survival (6·9 months [95% CI 6·1-7·0] vs 1·6 months [1·6-2·1]; HR 0·38 [95% CI 0·32-0·46]; p<0·0001). For the 598 (91%) patients with BRAF(V600E) disease, median overall survival in the vemurafenib group was 13·3 months (95% CI 11·9-14·9) compared with 10·0 months (8·0-14·0) in the dacarbazine group (HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·60-0·93]; p=0·0085); median progression-free survival was 6·9 months (95% CI 6·2-7·0) and 1·6 months (1·6-2·1), respectively (HR 0·39 [95% CI 0·33-0·47]; p<0·0001). For the 57 (9%) patients with BRAF(V600K) disease, median overall survival in the vemurafenib group was 14·5 months (95% CI 11·2-not estimable) compared with 7·6 months (6·1-16·6) in the dacarbazine group (HR 0·43 [95% CI 0·21-0·90]; p=0·024); median progression-free survival was 5·9 months (95% CI 4·4-9·0) and 1·7 months (1·4-2·9), respectively (HR 0·30 [95% CI 0·16-0·56]; p<0·0001). The most frequent grade 3-4 events were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (65 [19%] of 337 patients) and keratoacanthomas (34 [10%]), rash (30 [9%]), and abnormal liver function tests (38 [11%]) in the vemurafenib group and neutropenia (26 [9%] of 287 patients) in the dacarbazine group. Eight (2%) patients in the vemurafenib group and seven (2%) in the dacarbazine group had grade 5 events. INTERPRETATION: Inhibition of BRAF with vemurafenib improves survival in patients with the most common BRAF(V600E) mutation and in patients with the less common BRAF(V600K) mutation.

Clinically relevant subtypes exist for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but molecular characterization is not yet standard in clinical care. We implemented a biopsy protocol to perform time-sensitive whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing for patients with advanced PDAC. Therapeutically relevant genomic alterations were identified in 48% (34/71) and pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline alterations in 18% (13/71) of patients. Overall, 30% (21/71) of enrolled patients experienced a change in clinical management as a result of genomic data. Twenty-six patients had germline and/or somatic alterations in DNA-damage repair genes, and 5 additional patients had mutational signatures of homologous recombination deficiency but no identified causal genomic alteration. Two patients had oncogenic in-frame <i>BRAF</i> deletions, and we report the first clinical evidence that this alteration confers sensitivity to MAPK pathway inhibition. Moreover, we identified tumor/stroma gene expression signatures with clinical relevance. Collectively, these data demonstrate the feasibility and value of real-time genomic characterization of advanced PDAC.<b>Significance:</b> Molecular analyses of metastatic PDAC tumors are challenging due to the heterogeneous cellular composition of biopsy specimens and rapid progression of the disease. Using an integrated multidisciplinary biopsy program, we demonstrate that real-time genomic characterization of advanced PDAC can identify clinically relevant alterations that inform management of this difficult disease. <i>Cancer Discov; 8(9); 1096-111. ©2018 AACR.</i><i>See related commentary by Collisson, p. 1062</i><i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1047</i>.

d48023f5-2a4e-5ee5-952c-ff749f4718cb	D	ATM mutations uniformly lead to ATM dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: application of functional test using doxorubicin.	ATM abnormalities are frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and represent an important prognostic factor. Sole 11q deletion does not result in ATM inactivation by contrast to biallelic defects involving mutations. Therefore, the analysis of ATM mutations and their functional impact is crucial. In this study, we analyzed ATM mutations in predominantly high-risk patients using: i) resequencing microarray and direct sequencing; ii) Western blot for total ATM level; iii) functional test based on p21 gene induction after parallel treatment of leukemic cells with fludarabine and doxorubicin. ATM dysfunction leads to impaired p21 induction after doxorubicin exposure. We detected ATM mutation in 16% (22 of 140) of patients, and all mutated samples manifested demonstrable ATM defect (impaired p21 upregulation after doxorubicin and/or null protein level). Loss of ATM function in mutated samples was also evidenced through defective p53 pathway activation after ionizing radiation exposure. ATM mutation frequency was 34% in patients with 11q deletion, 4% in the TP53-defected group, and 8% in wild-type patients. Our functional test, convenient for routine use, showed high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (97%) for ATM mutations prediction. Only cells with ATM mutation, but not those with sole 11q deletion, were resistant to doxorubicin. As far as fludarabine is concerned, this difference was not observed. Interestingly, patients from both these groups experienced nearly identical time to first treatment. In conclusion, ATM mutations either alone or in combination with 11q deletion uniformly led to demonstrable ATM dysfunction in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mutation presence can be predicted by the functional test using doxorubicin.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from 140 patients, which is a substantial cohort (>5 patients). It analyzes ATM mutations and their functional impact, and develops a functional test with reported sensitivity (80%) and specificity (97%), indicating statistical results from clinical observations.

1a0a8f22-0808-5cf8-89d8-647b1bd7709c	C	Effects of KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab plus chemotherapy in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective consortium analysis.	BACKGROUND: Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. METHODS: 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. FINDINGS: 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. INTERPRETATION: While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.

c870d3d0-26f5-5708-85c5-86c81fcc3af0	D	LKB1 gene inactivation does not sensitize non-small cell lung cancer cells to mTOR inhibitors in vitro.	AIM: Previous study has shown that endometrial cancers with LKB1 inactivation are highly responsive to mTOR inhibitors. In this study we examined the effect of LKB1 gene status on mTOR inhibitor responses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. METHODS: Lung cancer cell lines Calu-1, H460, H1299, H1792, and A549 were treated with the mTOR inhibitors rapamycin or everolimus (RAD001). The mTOR activity was evaluated by measuring the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6K, the two primary mTOR substrates. Cells proliferation was measured by MTS or sulforhodamine B assays. RESULTS: The basal level of mTOR activity in LKB1 mutant A549 and H460 cells was significantly higher than that in LKB1 wild-type Calu-1 and H1792 cells. However, the LKB1 mutant A549 and H460 cells were not more sensitive to the mTOR inhibitors than the LKB1 wild-type Calu-1 and H1792 cells. Moreover, knockdown of LKB1 gene in H1299 cells did not increase the sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitors. Treatment with rapamycin or RAD001 significantly increased the phosphorylation of AKT in both LKB1 wild-type and LKB1 mutant NSCLC cells, which was attenuated by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Furthermore, RAD001 combined with LY294002 markedly enhanced the growth inhibition on LKB1 wild-type H1792 cells and LKB1 mutant A549 cells. CONCLUSION: LKB1 gene inactivation in NSCLC cells does not increase the sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitors. The negative feedback activation of AKT by mTOR inhibition may contribute to the resistance of NSCLC cells to mTOR inhibitors.	D	high	The study exclusively uses lung cancer cell lines (Calu-1, H460, H1299, H1792, and A549) and conducts experiments in vitro, which falls under the definition of preclinical evidence.
3f49b91f-edc0-58d9-9063-f27483f7da63	C	Dasatinib in imatinib-resistant Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias.	BACKGROUND: The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is effective in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) leukemias, but relapse occurs, mainly as a result of the outgrowth of leukemic subclones with imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations. We evaluated dasatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor that targets most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Patients with various phases of CML or with Ph-positive ALL who could not tolerate or were resistant to imatinib were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation study. Dasatinib (15 to 240 mg per day) was administered orally in four-week treatment cycles, once or twice daily. RESULTS: A complete hematologic response was achieved in 37 of 40 patients with chronic-phase CML, and major hematologic responses were seen in 31 of 44 patients with accelerated-phase CML, CML with blast crisis, or Ph-positive ALL. In these two phases, the rates of major cytogenetic response were 45 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Responses were maintained in 95 percent of patients with chronic-phase disease and in 82 percent of patients with accelerated-phase disease, with a median follow-up more than 12 months and 5 months, respectively. Nearly all patients with lymphoid blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL had a relapse within six months. Responses occurred among all BCR-ABL genotypes, with the exception of the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to both dasatinib and imatinib in vitro. Myelosuppression was common but not dose-limiting. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib induces hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with CML or Ph-positive ALL who cannot tolerate or are resistant to imatinib. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00064233 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).	B	high	The abstract describes a phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial involving human patients (40 patients with chronic-phase CML, 44 patients with accelerated-phase CML, CML with blast crisis, or Ph-positive ALL).

d432b937-0d38-5400-86d7-c370f91e0c72	D	Loss of STK11 expression is an early event in prostate carcinogenesis and predicts therapeutic response to targeted therapy against MAPK/p38.	Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to its development and progression are not yet fully elucidated. Of note, it has been recently shown that conditional stk11 knockout mice develop atypical hyperplasia and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). We recently reported an inverse correlation between the activity of the STK11/AMPK pathway and the MAPK/p38 cascade in HIF1A-dependent malignancies. Furthermore, MAPK/p38 overactivation was detected in benign prostate hyperplasia, PIN and PCa in mice and humans. Here we report that STK11 expression is significantly decreased in PCa compared to normal tissues. Moreover, STK11 protein levels decreased throughout prostate carcinogenesis. To gain insight into the role of STK11-MAPK/p38 activity balance in PCa, we treated PCa cell lines and primary biopsies with a well-established MAPK14-MAPK11 inhibitor (SB202190), which has been extensively used in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that inhibition of MAPK/p38 significantly affects PCa cell survival in an STK11-dependent manner. Indeed, we found that pharmacologic inactivation of MAPK/p38 does not affect viability of STK11-proficient PCa cells due to the triggering of the AMPK-dependent autophagic pathway, while it induces apoptosis in STK11-deficient cells irrespective of androgen receptor (AR) status. Of note, AMPK inactivation or autophagy inhibition in STK11-proficient cells sensitize SB202190-treated PCa cells to apoptosis. On the other end, reconstitution of functional STK11 in STK11-deficient PCa cells abrogates apoptosis. Collectively, our data show that STK11 is a key factor involved in the early phases of prostate carcinogenesis, and suggest that it might be used as a predictive marker of therapeutic response to MAPK/p38 inhibitors in PCa patients.	D	high	The study primarily relies on preclinical evidence, including experiments with conditional STK11 knockout mice (in vivo), prostate cancer cell lines (in vitro), and primary biopsies (ex vivo). While it mentions observations in human tissues regarding STK11 expression and MAPK/p38 activation, the therapeutic response to MAPK/p38 inhibitors is investigated in cell lines and biopsies, not in human patients within a clinical trial setting. This aligns with the definition of Level D, which covers in vivo or in vitro models and is not direct human evidence.

BACKGROUND: Previous trials have shown that anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies can improve clinical outcomes of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). We assessed the efficacy and safety of panitumumab combined with cisplatin and fluorouracil as first-line treatment for these patients. METHODS: This open-label phase 3 randomised trial was done at 126 sites in 26 countries. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years; had histologically or cytologically confirmed SCCHN; had distant metastatic or locoregionally recurrent disease, or both, that was deemed to be incurable by surgery or radiotherapy; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less; and had adequate haematological, renal, hepatic, and cardiac function. Patients were randomly assigned according to a computer-generated randomisation sequence (1:1; stratified by previous treatment, primary tumour site, and performance status) to one of two groups. Patients in both groups received up to six 3-week cycles of intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each cycle) and fluorouracil (1000 mg/m(2) on days 1-4 of each cycle); those in the experimental group also received intravenous panitumumab (9 mg/kg on day 1 of each cycle). Patients in the experimental group could choose to continue maintenance panitumumab every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall survival and was analysed by intention to treat. In a prospectively defined retrospective analysis, we assessed tumour human papillomavirus (HPV) status as a potential predictive biomarker of outcomes with a validated p16-INK4A (henceforth, p16) immunohistochemical assay. Patients and investigators were aware of group assignment; study statisticians were masked until primary analysis; and the central laboratory assessing p16 status was masked to identification of patients and treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00460265. FINDINGS: Between May 15, 2007, and March 10, 2009, we randomly assigned 657 patients: 327 to the panitumumab group and 330 to the control group. Median overall survival was 11·1 months (95% CI 9·8-12·2) in the panitumumab group and 9·0 months (8·1-11·2) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·873, 95% CI 0·729-1·046; p=0·1403). Median progression-free survival was 5·8 months (95% CI 5·6-6·6) in the panitumumab group and 4·6 months (4·1-5·4) in the control group (HR 0·780, 95% CI 0·659-0·922; p=0·0036). Several grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent in the panitumumab group than in the control group: skin or eye toxicity (62 [19%] of 325 included in safety analyses vs six [2%] of 325), diarrhoea (15 [5%] vs four [1%]), hypomagnesaemia (40 [12%] vs 12 [4%]), hypokalaemia (33 [10%] vs 23 [7%]), and dehydration (16 [5%] vs seven [2%]). Treatment-related deaths occurred in 14 patients (4%) in the panitumumab group and eight (2%) in the control group. Five (2%) of the fatal adverse events in the panitumumab group were attributed to the experimental agent. We had appropriate samples to assess p16 status for 443 (67%) patients, of whom 99 (22%) were p16 positive. Median overall survival in patients with p16-negative tumours was longer in the panitumumab group than in the control group (11·7 months [95% CI 9·7-13·7] vs 8·6 months [6·9-11·1]; HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·58-0·93]; p=0·0115), but this difference was not shown for p16-positive patients (11·0 months [7·3-12·9] vs 12·6 months [7·7-17·4]; 1·00 [0·62-1·61]; p=0·998). In the control group, p16-positive patients had numerically, but not statistically, longer overall survival than did p16-negative patients (HR 0·70 [95% CI 0·47-1·04]). INTERPRETATION: Although the addition of panitumumab to chemotherapy did not improve overall survival in an unselected population of patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN, it improved progression-free survival and had an acceptable toxicity profile. p16 status could be a prognostic and predictive marker in patients treated with panitumumab and chemotherapy. Prospective assessment will be necessary to validate our biomarker findings. FUNDING: Amgen Inc.	A	high	This publication describes an 'open-label phase 3 randomised trial' involving 657 patients.

e8aa2c7b-b24e-5d0d-aa0c-b70bf9a5c2ad	C	Rucaparib in relapsed, platinum-sensitive high-grade ovarian carcinoma (ARIEL2 Part 1): an international, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial.	BACKGROUND: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have activity in ovarian carcinomas with homologous recombination deficiency. Along with BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) mutations genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) might also represent homologous recombination deficiency. In ARIEL2, we assessed the ability of tumour genomic LOH, quantified with a next-generation sequencing assay, to predict response to rucaparib, an oral PARP inhibitor. METHODS: ARIEL2 is an international, multicentre, two-part, phase 2, open-label study done at 49 hospitals and cancer centres in Australia, Canada, France, Spain, the UK, and the USA. In ARIEL2 Part 1, patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive, high-grade ovarian carcinoma were classified into one of three predefined homologous recombination deficiency subgroups on the basis of tumour mutational analysis: BRCA mutant (deleterious germline or somatic), BRCA wild-type and LOH high (LOH high group), or BRCA wild-type and LOH low (LOH low group). We prespecified a cutoff of 14% or more genomic LOH for LOH high. Patients began treatment with oral rucaparib at 600 mg twice per day for continuous 28 day cycles until disease progression or any other reason for discontinuation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. All patients treated with at least one dose of rucaparib were included in the safety analyses and all treated patients who were classified were included in the primary endpoint analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01891344. Enrolment into ARIEL2 Part 1 is complete, although an extension (Part 2) is ongoing. FINDINGS: 256 patients were screened and 206 were enrolled between Oct 30, 2013, and Dec 19, 2014. At the data cutoff date (Jan 18, 2016), 204 patients had received rucaparib, with 28 patients remaining in the study. 192 patients could be classified into one of the three predefined homologous recombination deficiency subgroups: BRCA mutant (n=40), LOH high (n=82), or LOH low (n=70). Tumours from 12 patients were established as BRCA wild-type, but could not be classified for LOH, because of insufficient neoplastic nuclei in the sample. The median duration of treatment for the 204 patients was 5·7 months (IQR 2·8-10·1). 24 patients in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 56 patients in the LOH high subgroup, and 59 patients in the LOH low subgroup had disease progression or died. Median progression-free survival after rucaparib treatment was 12·8 months (95% CI 9·0-14·7) in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 5·7 months (5·3-7·6) in the LOH high subgroup, and 5·2 months (3·6-5·5) in the LOH low subgroup. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the BRCA mutant (hazard ratio 0·27, 95% CI 0·16-0·44, p<0·0001) and LOH high (0·62, 0·42-0·90, p=0·011) subgroups compared with the LOH low subgroup. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were anaemia or decreased haemoglobin (45 [22%] patients), and elevations in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (25 [12%]). Common serious adverse events included small intestinal obstruction (10 [5%] of 204 patients), malignant neoplasm progression (10 [5%]), and anaemia (nine [4%]). Three patients died during the study (two because of disease progression and one because of sepsis and disease progression). No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: In patients with BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and LOH high platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinomas treated with rucaparib, progression-free survival was longer than in patients with BRCA wild-type LOH low carcinomas. Our results suggest that assessment of tumour LOH can be used to identify patients with BRCA wild-type platinum-sensitive ovarian cancers who might benefit from rucaparib. These results extend the potential usefulness of PARP inhibitors in the treatment setting beyond BRCA mutant tumours.

4e9bedd3-9995-5495-a60b-1acad74159c1	C	Correlation of kinase genotype and clinical outcome in the North American Intergroup Phase III Trial of imatinib mesylate for treatment of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor: CALGB 150105 Study by Cancer and Leukemia Group B and Southwest Oncology Group.	PURPOSE: Imatinib mesylate is standard treatment for patients who have advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), but not all patients benefit equally. In previous studies, GIST genotype correlated with treatment outcome and optimal imatinib dosing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the relationship between kinase genotype and treatment outcome for 428 patients enrolled on the North American phase III study SWOG S0033/CALGB 150105 and treated with either 400 mg or 800 mg daily doses of imatinib. RESULTS: The presence of KIT exon 11-mutant genotype (n = 283) correlated with improved treatment outcome when compared with KIT exon 9-mutant (n = 32) and wild-type (WT; n = 67) genotypes for objective response (complete response [CR]/partial response [PR], 71.7% v 44.4% [P = .007]; and 44.6% [P = .0002], respectively); time to tumor progression (TTP; median 24.7 months v 16.7 and 12.8 months, respectively); and overall survival (OS; median 60.0 months v 38.4 and 49.0 months, respectively). The survival outcomes for patients with exon 9-mutant, exon 11-mutant or WT GIST were not affected by imatinib dose. However, there was evidence of improved response rates for patients with exon 9-mutant tumors treated with imatinib 800 mg versus 400 mg (CR/PR, 67% v 17%; P = .02). Patients who had CD117-negative GIST had similar TTP but inferior OS compared with patients who had CD117-positive disease, which suggests that patients who have CD117-negative GIST may benefit from imatinib treatment. In addition, we identified novel but rare mutations of the KIT extracellular domain (exons 8 and 9). CONCLUSION: We confirmed the favorable impact of KIT exon 11 genotype when compared with KIT exon 9 and wild-type genotype for patients with advanced GIST who are treated with imatinib.

7f07140e-d289-5fe5-9a47-ff7b789a68ad	D	Long-Term ERK Inhibition in KRAS-Mutant Pancreatic Cancer Is Associated with MYC Degradation and Senescence-like Growth Suppression.	Induction of compensatory mechanisms and ERK reactivation has limited the effectiveness of Raf and MEK inhibitors in RAS-mutant cancers. We determined that direct pharmacologic inhibition of ERK suppressed the growth of a subset of KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines and that concurrent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition caused synergistic cell death. Additional combinations that enhanced ERK inhibitor action were also identified. Unexpectedly, long-term treatment of sensitive cell lines caused senescence, mediated in part by MYC degradation and p16 reactivation. Enhanced basal PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling was associated with de novo resistance to ERK inhibitor, as were other protein kinases identified by kinome-wide siRNA screening and a genetic gain-of-function screen. Our findings reveal distinct consequences of inhibiting this kinase cascade at the level of ERK.

e2eb8d0b-6275-5fe6-a3ab-9585984d3f48	B	Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor underlying responsiveness of non-small-cell lung cancer to gefitinib.	BACKGROUND: Most patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have no response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib, which targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, about 10 percent of patients have a rapid and often dramatic clinical response. The molecular mechanisms underlying sensitivity to gefitinib are unknown. METHODS: We searched for mutations in the EGFR gene in primary tumors from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who had a response to gefitinib, those who did not have a response, and those who had not been exposed to gefitinib. The functional consequences of identified mutations were evaluated after the mutant proteins were expressed in cultured cells. RESULTS: Somatic mutations were identified in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene in eight of nine patients with gefitinib-responsive lung cancer, as compared with none of the seven patients with no response (P<0.001). Mutations were either small, in-frame deletions or amino acid substitutions clustered around the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain. Similar mutations were detected in tumors from 2 of 25 patients with primary non-small-cell lung cancer who had not been exposed to gefitinib (8 percent). All mutations were heterozygous, and identical mutations were observed in multiple patients, suggesting an additive specific gain of function. In vitro, EGFR mutants demonstrated enhanced tyrosine kinase activity in response to epidermal growth factor and increased sensitivity to inhibition by gefitinib. CONCLUSIONS: A subgroup of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have specific mutations in the EGFR gene, which correlate with clinical responsiveness to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. These mutations lead to increased growth factor signaling and confer susceptibility to the inhibitor. Screening for such mutations in lung cancers may identify patients who will have a response to gefitinib.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from more than 5 patients (9 gefitinib-responsive, 7 non-responsive, and 25 unexposed patients) and presents statistical results (P<0.001) correlating EGFR mutations with clinical responsiveness to gefitinib. While it includes in vitro experiments, the core finding is based on direct human clinical evidence.
05dfc1ae-27e7-5005-bbd3-2cf1f23b1073	C	Activity of the oral MEK inhibitor trametinib in patients with advanced melanoma: a phase 1 dose-escalation trial.	BACKGROUND: MEK is a member of the MAPK signalling cascade that is commonly activated in melanoma. Direct inhibition of MEK blocks cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. We aimed to analyse safety, efficacy, and genotyping data for the oral, small-molecule MEK inhibitor trametinib in patients with melanoma. METHODS: We undertook a multicentre, phase 1 three-part study (dose escalation, cohort expansion, and pharmacodynamic assessment). The main results of this study are reported elsewhere; here we present data relating to patients with melanoma. We obtained tumour samples to assess BRAF mutational status, and available tissues underwent exploratory genotyping analysis. Disease response was measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and adverse events were defined by common toxicity criteria. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00687622. FINDINGS: 97 patients with melanoma were enrolled, including 81 with cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma (36 BRAF mutant, 39 BRAF wild-type, six BRAF status unknown), and 16 with uveal melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash or dermatitis acneiform (n=80; 82%) and diarrhoea (44; 45%), most of which were grade 2 or lower. No cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas were recorded. Of 36 patients with BRAF mutations, 30 had not received a BRAF inhibitor before; two complete responses (both confirmed) and ten partial responses (eight confirmed) were noted in this subgroup (confirmed response rate, 33%). Median progression-free survival of this subgroup was 5·7 months (95% CI 4·0-7·4). Of the six patients who had received previous BRAF inhibition, one unconfirmed partial response was recorded. Of 39 patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma, four partial responses were confirmed (confirmed response rate, 10%). INTERPRETATION: Our data show substantial clinical activity of trametinib in melanoma and suggest that MEK is a valid therapeutic target. Differences in response rates according to mutations indicate the importance of mutational analyses in the future. FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.

dbc36861-bb88-50c7-8771-ea30d105765d	B	Phase II trial of trastuzumab in women with advanced or recurrent, HER2-positive endometrial carcinoma: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.	PURPOSE: This study evaluated efficacy of single-agent trastuzumab against advanced or recurrent HER2-positive endometrial carcinoma (EC), and explored predictors for HER2 amplification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had measurable stage III, IV, or recurrent EC. There was no limit on prior therapy although total prior doxorubicin dose was limited to 320 mg/m(2). Tumors were required to have HER2 overexpression (2+ or 3+ immunohistochemical staining) or HER2 amplification (FISH HER2/CEP 17 ratio >2.0). Trastuzumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 4 mg/kg in week 1, then 2 mg/kg weekly until disease progression. The primary endpoint was tumor response. RESULTS: Of the 286 tumors centrally screened by LabCorp, 33 (11.5%) were HER2-amplified. Three of 8 clear (38%) cell carcinomas and 7 of 25 serous carcinomas (28%) screened exhibited HER2 amplification compared with 7% (2/29) of endometrioid adenocarcinomas. HER2 overexpression was correlated with HER2 amplification (r=0.459; p<0.0001). Thirty-four women were enrolled; 1 was excluded (refused treatment); and 18 had tumors with known HER2 amplification. No major tumor responses were observed. Twelve women experienced stable disease, 18 had increasing disease, and 3 were indeterminate for tumor response. Neither HER2 overexpression nor HER2 amplification appeared to be associated with progression-free survival or overall survival. CONCLUSION: Trastuzumab as a single agent did not demonstrate activity against endometrial carcinomas with HER2 overexpression or HER2 amplification, although full planned accrual of women with HER2 amplified tumors was not achieved due to slow recruitment. Serous and clear cell endometrial carcinomas appear to be more likely to demonstrate HER2 amplification.

c76b34d3-70f9-549e-93cc-399b7e1d9ac4	B	Evaluation of the association of PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss with efficacy of trastuzumab therapy in metastatic breast cancer.	Trastuzumab (T) is effective in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with HER2 overexpression and/or amplification, but resistance to T develops in a significant number of HER2-positive patients. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance is critical to the care of these patients. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were collected from 256 patients with T-treated MBC. Clinical information was collected retrospectively from the patients' medical records. Central review of HER2 status by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that of the 227 eligible patients only 139 (61%) were truly HER2-positive. PTEN, ER, PgR, and Ki67 were evaluated by IHC, while PTEN status was evaluated by FISH as well. PIK3CA mutations were identified with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Median time to progression (TTP) was 14.4 months for the HER2-positive and 10.3 for the HER2-negative patients (log-rank, P = 0.22). Survival from the initiation of T (survivalT) was 50.4 months for the HER2-positive and 35.3 for the HER2-negative subgroups (P = 0.006). Higher risk of progression was associated with HER2-positive status and the presence of PIK3CA mutations (P = 0.014). PTEN loss, as determined by IHC, was associated with lower survivalT in the whole population (P = 0.029) and in the HER2-positive population (P = 0.017). PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss status were evaluated together as a single parameter, to estimate the impact of activation of the PI3K/AKT molecular pathway, and it was significantly associated with both decreased TTP (P = 0.003 in the total population, P = 0.004 in HER2-positive patients) and survival (survivalT, P = 0.011 in total, P = 0.006 in HER2-positive). In this trastuzumab-treated breast cancer population, PIK3CA activating mutations were associated with shorter TTP and PTEN loss with decreased survival. The activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway from either defect was associated with both TTP and survival, indicating the adverse effect of this pathway's status on trastuzumab efficacy.	B	high	This study involves the collection and analysis of primary patient data from 256 individuals with metastatic breast cancer, exceeding the 5-patient threshold for Level B. It is a retrospective analysis of clinical information and tumor tissue samples, providing statistical results (e.g., P-values for TTP and survival associations) regarding the efficacy of trastuzumab therapy in relation to PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss. While it provides clinical evidence, it is not a prospective randomized controlled trial or a consensus guideline, making it less definitive than Level A.

PURPOSE: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase has been an important target for non-small-cell lung cancer. Several EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are currently approved, and both gefitinib and erlotinib are the most well-known first-generation EGFR-TKIs. This randomized phase III study was conducted to investigate the difference between these two EGFR-TKIs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously treated patients with lung adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to receive gefitinib or erlotinib. This study aimed to investigate the noninferiority of gefitinib compared with erlotinib. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Five hundred sixty-one patients were randomly assigned, including 401 patients (71.7%) with EGFR mutation. All baseline factors (except performance status) were balanced between the arms. Median PFS and overall survival times for gefitinib and erlotinib were 6.5 and 7.5 months (hazard ratio [HR], 1.125; 95% CI, 0.940 to 1.347; P = .257) and 22.8 and 24.5 months (HR, 1.038; 95% CI, 0.833 to 1.294; P = .768), respectively. The response rates for gefitinib and erlotinib were 45.9% and 44.1%, respectively. Median PFS times in EGFR mutation-positive patients receiving gefitinib versus erlotinib were 8.3 and 10.0 months, respectively (HR, 1.093; 95% CI, 0.879 to 1.358; P = .424). The primary grade 3 or 4 toxicities were rash (2.2% for gefitinib v 18.1% for erlotinib) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation (6.1%/13.0% for gefitinib v 2.2%/3.3% for erlotinib).

f231b7f1-7758-5732-af41-d2c9825f1fd9	B	Meta-analysis of BRAF mutation as a predictive biomarker of benefit from anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.	BACKGROUND: Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that harbours a BRAF V600E mutation (BRAF MT) is associated with poorer outcomes. However, whether this mutation is predictive of treatment benefit from anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to July 2014 that evaluated the effect of BRAF MT on the treatment benefit from anti-EGFR mAbs for mCRC. RESULTS: Seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria for assessment of overall survival (OS), whereas eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria for assessment of progression-free survival (PFS). For RAS WT/BRAF MT tumours, the hazard ratio for OS benefit with anti-EGFR mAbs was 0.97 (95% CI; 0.67-1.41), whereas the hazard ratio was 0.81 (95% CI; 0.70-0.95) for RAS WT/BRAF WT tumours. However, the test of interaction (P=0.43) was not statistically significant, highlighting that the observed differences in the effect of anti-EGFR mAbs on OS according to the BRAF mutation status may be due to chance alone. Regarding PFS benefit with anti-EGFR mAbs, the hazard ratio was 0.86 (95% CI; 0.61-1.21) for RAS WT/BRAF MT tumours as compared with 0.62 (95% CI; 0.50-0.77) for RAS WT/BRAF WT tumours (test of interaction, P=0.07). INTERPRETATION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that there is insufficient evidence to definitively state that RAS WT/BRAF MT individuals attain a different treatment benefit from anti-EGFR mAbs for mCRC compared with RAS WT/BRAF WT individuals. As such, there are insufficient data to justify the exclusion of anti-EGFR mAb therapy for patients with RAS WT/BRAF MT mCRC.

Our results suggest that assessment of tumour LOH can be used to identify patients with BRCA wild-type platinum-sensitive ovarian cancers who might benefit from rucaparib. These results extend the potential usefulness of PARP inhibitors in the treatment setting beyond BRCA mutant tumours.

98deea7b-e942-5ab0-84db-21f6920ac230	D	Reversing melanoma cross-resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors by co-targeting the AKT/mTOR pathway.	BACKGROUND: The sustained clinical activity of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032/RG7204) in patients with BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma is limited primarily by the development of acquired resistance leading to tumor progression. Clinical trials are in progress using MEK inhibitors following disease progression in patients receiving BRAF inhibitors. However, the PI3K/AKT pathway can also induce resistance to the inhibitors of MAPK pathway. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The sensitivity to vemurafenib or the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 was tested in sensitive and resistant human melanoma cell lines exploring differences in activation-associated phosphorylation levels of major signaling molecules, leading to the testing of co-inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway genetically and pharmacologically. There was a high degree of cross-resistance to vemurafenib and AZD6244, except in two vemurafenib-resistant cell lines that acquired a secondary mutation in NRAS. In other cell lines, acquired resistance to both drugs was associated with persistence or increase in activity of AKT pathway. siRNA-mediated gene silencing and combination therapy with an AKT inhibitor or rapamycin partially or completely reversed the resistance. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Primary and acquired resistance to vemurafenib in these in vitro models results in frequent cross resistance to MEK inhibitors, except when the resistance is the result of a secondary NRAS mutation. Resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors is associated with the induction or persistence of activity within the AKT pathway in the presence of these drugs. This resistance can be potentially reversed by the combination of a RAF or MEK inhibitor with an AKT or mTOR inhibitor. These combinations should be available for clinical testing in patients progressing on BRAF inhibitors.	D	high	The study was conducted using human melanoma cell lines (in vitro models) to investigate drug resistance and potential therapeutic strategies. This falls under preclinical evidence, as it is not direct human evidence.

BACKGROUND: Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC) is a recently described pathologic entity. We report the case of a patient with an initial diagnosis of salivary acinic cell carcinoma later reclassified as MASC after next-generation sequencing revealed an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This alteration was targeted with the pan-Trk inhibitor entrectinib (Ignyta), which possesses potent in vitro activity against cell lines containing various NTRK1/2/3 fusions. RESULTS: A dramatic and durable response was achieved with entrectinib in this patient, followed by acquired resistance that correlated with the appearance of a novel NTRK3 G623R mutation. Structural modeling predicts that this alteration sterically interferes with drug binding, correlating to decreased sensitivity to drug inhibition observed in cell-based assays. CONCLUSIONS: This first report of clinical activity with TrkC inhibition and the development of acquired resistance in an NTRK3-rearranged cancer emphasize the utility of comprehensive molecular profiling and targeted therapy for rare malignancies (NCT02097810).

5811b775-71cb-5ebd-9deb-a33321a5ea5f	D	Anti-tumor activity of motesanib in a medullary thyroid cancer model.	BACKGROUND: Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is frequently associated with mutations in the tyrosine kinase Ret and with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Motesanib is an investigational, orally administered small molecule antagonist of VEGFR1, 2, and 3; platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR); Kit; and possibly Ret. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of motesanib on wildtype and mutant Ret activity in vitro and on tumor xenograft growth in a mouse model of MTC. METHODS/RESULTS: In cellular phosphorylation assays, motesanib inhibited the activity of wild-type Ret (IC(50)=66 nM), while it had limited activity against mutant Ret C634W (IC(50)=1100 nM) or Ret M918T (IC(50)>2500 nM). In vivo, motesanib significantly inhibited the growth of TT tumor cell xenografts (expressing Ret C634W) and significantly reduced tumor blood vessel area and tumor cell proliferation, compared with control. Treatment with motesanib resulted in substantial inhibition of Ret tyrosine phosphorylation in TT xenografts and, at comparable doses, in equivalent inhibition of VEGFR2 phosphorylation in both TT xenografts and in mouse lung tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that motesanib inhibited thyroid tumor xenograft growth predominantly through inhibition of angiogenesis and possibly via a direct inhibition of VEGFR2 and Ret expressed on tumor cells. These data suggest that targeting angiogenesis pathways and specifically the VEGF pathway may represent a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of MTC.	D	high	The study investigates the effects of motesanib using in vitro cellular phosphorylation assays and in vivo mouse xenograft models of medullary thyroid cancer.

BACKGROUND: Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. METHODS: 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. FINDINGS: 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. INTERPRETATION: While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.

Bosutinib, a dual Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has shown potent activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This phase 1/2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily bosutinib 500 mg in leukemia patients after resistance/intolerance to imatinib. The current analysis included 118 patients with chronic-phase CML who had been pretreated with imatinib followed by dasatinib and/or nilotinib, with a median follow-up of 28.5 months. In this subpopulation, major cytogenetic response was attained by 32% of patients; complete cytogenetic response was attained by 24%, including in one of 3 patients treated with 3 prior TKIs. Complete hematologic response was achieved/maintained in 73% of patients. On-treatment transformation to accelerated/blast phase occurred in 5 patients. At 2 years, Kaplan-Meier-estimated progression-free survival was 73% and estimated overall survival was 83%. Responses were seen across Bcr-Abl mutations, including those associated with dasatinib and nilotinib resistance, except T315I. Bosutinib had an acceptable safety profile; treatment-emergent adverse events were primarily manageable grade 1/2 gastrointestinal events and rash. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic adverse events (> 2% of patients) included diarrhea (8%) and rash (4%). Bosutinib may offer a new treatment option for patients with chronic-phase CML after treatment with multiple TKIs. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00261846.

We evaluated clinical and molecular characteristics of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with <i>RASA1</i> mutations in comparison with <i>NF1</i>-mutated cases.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Large genomic datasets of NSCLC [MSK-IMPACT dataset at MSKCC (<i>n</i> = 2,004), TCGA combined lung cancer dataset (<i>n</i> = 1,144)] were analyzed to define concurrent mutations and clinical features of <i>RASA1</i>-mutated NSCLCs. Functional studies were performed using immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) and NSCLC lines with truncating mutations in <i>RASA1, NF1</i>, or both.<b>Results:</b> Overall, approximately 2% of NSCLCs had <i>RASA1</i>-truncating mutations, and this alteration was statistically, but not completely, mutually exclusive with known activating <i>EGFR</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.02) and <i>KRAS</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.02) mutations. Unexpectedly, <i>RASA1</i>-truncating mutations had a strong tendency to co-occur with <i>NF1</i>-truncating mutations (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Furthermore, all patients (16/16) with concurrent <i>RASA1/NF1</i>-truncating mutations lacked other known lung cancer drivers. Knockdown of RASA1 in HBECs activated signaling downstream of RAS and promoted cell growth. Conversely, restoration of RASA1 expression in <i>RASA1</i>-mutated cells reduced MAPK and PI3K signaling. Although growth of cell lines with inactivation of only one of these two RasGAPs showed moderate and variable sensitivity to inhibitors of MEK or PI3K, cells with concurrent <i>RASA1/NF1</i> mutations were profoundly more sensitive (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.040 μmol/L trametinib). Finally, simultaneous genetic silencing of <i>RASA1</i> and <i>NF1</i> sensitized both HBECs and NSCLC cells to MEK inhibition.<b>Conclusions:</b> Cancer genomic and functional data nominate concurrent <i>RASA1/NF1</i> loss-of-function mutations as a strong mitogenic driver in NSCLC, which may sensitize to trametinib. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(6); 1436-47. ©2017 AACR</i><i>See related commentary by Kitajima and Barbie, p. 1243</i>.

58d9720d-4b81-53a9-8299-e2d93b2ef705	D	Mutations of FLT3/ITD confer resistance to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors.	FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) normally functions in the survival/proliferation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, but its constitutive activation by internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations correlates with a poor prognosis in AML. The development of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is a promising strategy, but resistance that arises during the course of treatment caused by secondary mutations within the mutated gene itself poses a significant challenge. In an effort to predict FLT3 resistance mutations that might develop in patients, we used saturation mutagenesis of FLT3/ITD followed by selection of transfected cells in FLT3 TKI. We identified F621L, A627P, F691L and Y842C mutations in FLT3/ITD that confer varying levels of resistance to FLT3 TKI. Western blotting confirmed that some FLT3 TKI were ineffective at inhibiting FLT3 autophosphorylation and signaling through MAP kinase, STAT5 and AKT in some mutants. Balb/c mice transplanted with the FLT3/ITD Y842C mutation confirmed resistance to sorafenib in vivo but not to lestaurtinib. These results indicate a growing number of FLT3 mutations that are likely to be encountered in patients. Such knowledge, combined with known remaining sensitivity to other FLT3 TKI, will be important to establish as secondary drug treatments that can be substituted when these mutants are encountered.	D	high	The study primarily uses in vitro models (saturation mutagenesis of FLT3/ITD in transfected cells, Western blotting) and in vivo models (Balb/c mice transplanted with FLT3/ITD mutation) to investigate resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

39834784-d4bd-5222-9813-eb1640a23533	B	TFF3 is a valuable predictive biomarker of endocrine response in metastatic breast cancer.	The stratification of breast cancer patients for endocrine therapies by oestrogen or progesterone receptor expression is effective but imperfect. The present study aims were to validate microarray studies that demonstrate TFF3 regulation by oestrogen and its association with oestrogen receptors in breast cancer, to evaluate TFF3 as a biomarker of endocrine response, and to investigate TFF3 function. Microarray data were validated by quantitative RT-PCR and northern and western transfer analyses. TFF3 was induced by oestrogen, and its induction was inhibited by antioestrogens, tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and fulvestrant in oestrogen-responsive breast cancer cells. The expression of TFF3 mRNA was associated with oestrogen receptor mRNA in breast tumours (Pearson's coefficient=0.762, P=0.000). Monoclonal antibodies raised against the TFF3 protein detected TFF3 by immunohistochemistry in oesophageal submucosal glands, intestinal goblet and neuroendocrine cells, Barrett's metaplasia and intestinal metaplasia. TFF3 protein expression was associated with oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and TFF1 expression in malignant breast cells. TFF3 is a specific and sensitive predictive biomarker of response to endocrine therapy, degree of response and duration of response in unstratified metastatic breast cancer patients (P=0.000, P=0.002 and P=0.002 respectively). Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that TFF3 is an independent biomarker of endocrine response and degree of response, and this was confirmed in a validation cohort. TFF3 stimulated migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. In conclusion, TFF3 expression is associated with response to endocrine therapy, and outperforms oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and TFF1 as an independent biomarker, possibly because it mediates the malign effects of oestrogen on invasion and metastasis.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data, evaluating TFF3 as a predictive biomarker of endocrine response in metastatic breast cancer patients. It includes statistical results (P-values) and confirmation in a validation cohort, which aligns with the definition of Clinical Evidence (Level B). While some preclinical (in vitro) work is mentioned, the core findings regarding biomarker performance are derived from human patient cohorts.
cc8be07f-c9cf-57ef-9a10-15575edddd76	D	Comparative analysis of two clinically active BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors reveals the role of conformation-specific binding in resistance.	Structural studies suggest that most point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain cause resistance to the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib by impairing the flexibility of the kinase domain, restricting its ability to adopt the inactive conformation required for optimal imatinib binding, rather than by directly interfering with drug contact residues. BMS-354825, currently in clinical development for imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia, is a dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor that binds ABL in both the active and inactive conformation. To examine the potential role of conformational binding properties in drug resistance, we mapped the mutations in BCR-ABL capable of conferring resistance to BMS-354825. Through saturation mutagenesis, we identified 10 such BCR-ABL mutations, 8 of which occurred at drug contact residues. Some mutants were unique to BMS-354825, whereas others also conferred imatinib resistance. Remarkably, the identity of the amino acid substitution at either of two contact residues differentially affects sensitivity to imatinib or BMS-354825. The combination of imatinib plus BMS-354825 greatly reduced the recovery of drug-resistant clones. Our findings provide further rationale for considering kinase conformation in the design of kinase inhibitors against cancer targets.	D	high	The study describes mapping mutations through saturation mutagenesis and examining their effects on drug resistance, likely in an in vitro model (e.g., cell lines), as indicated by 'recovery of drug-resistant clones'.

BACKGROUND: Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is characterized by a gene-expression profile similar to that of BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, alterations of lymphoid transcription factor genes, and a poor outcome. The frequency and spectrum of genetic alterations in Ph-like ALL and its responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibition are undefined, especially in adolescents and adults. METHODS: We performed genomic profiling of 1725 patients with precursor B-cell ALL and detailed genomic analysis of 154 patients with Ph-like ALL. We examined the functional effects of fusion proteins and the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in mouse pre-B cells and xenografts of human Ph-like ALL. RESULTS: Ph-like ALL increased in frequency from 10% among children with standard-risk ALL to 27% among young adults with ALL and was associated with a poor outcome. Kinase-activating alterations were identified in 91% of patients with Ph-like ALL; rearrangements involving ABL1, ABL2, CRLF2, CSF1R, EPOR, JAK2, NTRK3, PDGFRB, PTK2B, TSLP, or TYK2 and sequence mutations involving FLT3, IL7R, or SH2B3 were most common. Expression of ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, JAK2, and PDGFRB fusions resulted in cytokine-independent proliferation and activation of phosphorylated STAT5. Cell lines and human leukemic cells expressing ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, and PDGFRB fusions were sensitive in vitro to dasatinib, EPOR and JAK2 rearrangements were sensitive to ruxolitinib, and the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion was sensitive to crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Ph-like ALL was found to be characterized by a range of genomic alterations that activate a limited number of signaling pathways, all of which may be amenable to inhibition with approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Trials identifying Ph-like ALL are needed to assess whether adding tyrosine kinase inhibitors to current therapy will improve the survival of patients with this type of leukemia.

While it includes preclinical components, the extensive primary patient data and the identification of targetable lesions in a significant human cohort classify it as clinical evidence, fitting Level B.
14eb4da2-65e1-5495-94f8-81494e180630	D	Comparison of imatinib mesylate, dasatinib (BMS-354825), and nilotinib (AMN107) in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-based mutagenesis screen: high efficacy of drug combinations.	BMS-354825 (dasatinib) and AMN107 (nilotinib) are potent alternate Abl inhibitors with activity against many imatinib mesylate-resistant BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutants, except T315I. We used N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-exposed Ba/F3-p210(BCR-ABL) cells to compare incidence and types of KD mutants emerging in the presence of imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, and nilotinib, alone and in dual combinations. Although ENU is expected to induce mutations in multiple proteins, resistant clones were almost exclusively BCR-ABL KD mutant at relevant concentrations of nilotinib and dasatinib, consistent with a central role of KD mutations for resistance to these drugs. Twenty different mutations were identified with imatinib mesylate, 10 with nilotinib (including only 1 novel mutation, E292V) and 9 with dasatinib. At intermediate drug levels the spectrum narrowed to F317V and T315I for dasatinib and Y253H, E255V, and T315I for nilotinib. Thus, cross-resistance is limited to T315I, which is also the only mutant isolated at drug concentrations equivalent to maximal achievable plasma trough levels. With drug combinations maximal suppression of resistant clone outgrowth was achieved at lower concentrations compared with single agents, suggesting that such combinations may be equipotent to higher-dose single agents. However, sequencing uniformly revealed T315I, consistent with the need for a T315I inhibitor, to completely block resistance.	D	high	The study was conducted using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-exposed Ba/F3-p210(BCR-ABL) cells, which are in vitro cell line models. This classifies the evidence as preclinical.

PURPOSE: Copy number alterations have been shown to be involved in melanoma pathogenesis. The randomized phase III clinical trial E2603: carboplatin, paclitaxel, ± sorafenib (CP vs. CPS) offers a large collection of tumor samples to evaluate association of somatic mutations, genomic alterations, and clinical outcomes, prior to current FDA-approved therapies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Copy number and mutational analysis on 119 pretreatment samples was performed. RESULTS: CPS therapy was associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with CP in patients with tumors with RAF1 (cRAF) gene copy gains (HR, 0.372; P = 0.025) or CCND1 gene copy gains (HR, 0.45; P = 0.035). CPS therapy was associated with improved overall survival (OS) compared with CP in patients with tumors with KRAS gene copy gains (HR, 0.25; P = 0.035). BRAF gene copy gain and MET amplification were more common in samples with V600K versus V600E mutations (P < 0.001), which was validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. CONCLUSIONS: We observed improved treatment response with CPS in patients with melanoma whose tumors have RAF1 (cRAF), KRAS, or CCND1 amplification, all of which can be attributed to sorafenib targeting CRAF. These genomic alterations should be incorporated in future studies for evaluation as biomarkers.	B	high	The study analyzes data from a randomized phase III clinical trial (E2603) involving 119 pretreatment samples. It presents statistically significant associations between copy number changes and clinical outcomes (PFS and OS) in patients treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and sorafenib. This constitutes strong clinical evidence derived from a large patient cohort within a clinical trial setting, fitting the criteria for Level B.

PIK3CA, which encodes the p110α subunit of PI3K, is frequently mutated and oncogenic in breast cancer. PI3Kα inhibitors are in clinical development and despite promising early clinical activity, intrinsic resistance is frequent among patients. We have previously reported that residual downstream mTORC1 activity upon treatment with PI3Kα inhibitors drives resistance to these agents. However, the mechanism underlying this phenotype is not fully understood. Here we show that in cancer cells resistant to PI3Kα inhibition, PDK1 blockade restores sensitivity to these therapies. SGK1, which is activated by PDK1, contributes to the maintenance of residual mTORC1 activity through direct phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC2. Targeting either PDK1 or SGK1 prevents mTORC1 activation, restoring the antitumoral effects of PI3Kα inhibition in resistant cells.	D	high	The abstract describes findings in 'cancer cells' and mechanisms observed within these cells, indicating an in vitro (cell line) study. This falls under preclinical evidence.

Purpose Detection of specific molecular alterations in tumors guides the selection of effective targeted treatment of patients with several types of cancer. These molecular alterations may occur in other tumor types for which the efficacy of targeted therapy remains unclear. The MyPathway study evaluates the efficacy and safety of selected targeted therapies in tumor types that harbor relevant genetic alterations but are outside of current labeling for these treatments. Methods MyPathway ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02091141) is a multicenter, nonrandomized, phase IIa multiple basket study. Patients with advanced refractory solid tumors harboring molecular alterations in human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1, or the Hedgehog pathway are treated with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively. The primary end point is investigator-assessed objective response rate within each tumor-pathway cohort. Results Between April 1, 2014 and November 1, 2016, 251 patients with 35 different tumor types received study treatment. The efficacy population contains 230 treated patients who were evaluated for response or discontinued treatment before evaluation. Fifty-two patients (23%) with 14 different tumor types had objective responses (complete, n = 4; partial, n = 48). Tumor-pathway cohorts with notable objective response rates included human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-amplified/overexpressing colorectal (38% [14 of 37]; 95% CI, 23% to 55%) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 V600-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (43% [six of 14]; 95% CI, 18% to 71%).

Effective targeted therapies for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), the most aggressive form of lung cancer, remain urgently needed. Here we report evidence of preclinical efficacy evoked by targeting the overexpressed cell-cycle checkpoint kinase CHK1 in SCLC. Our studies employed RNAi-mediated attenuation or pharmacologic blockade with the novel second-generation CHK1 inhibitor prexasertib (LY2606368), currently in clinical trials. In SCLC models <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, LY2606368 exhibited strong single-agent efficacy, augmented the effects of cisplatin or the PARP inhibitor olaparib, and improved the response of platinum-resistant models. Proteomic analysis identified CHK1 and MYC as top predictive biomarkers of LY2606368 sensitivity, suggesting that CHK1 inhibition may be especially effective in SCLC with <i>MYC</i> amplification or MYC protein overexpression. Our findings provide a preclinical proof of concept supporting the initiation of a clinical efficacy trial in patients with platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant relapsed SCLC. <i>Cancer Res; 77(14); 3870-84. ©2017 AACR</i>.

Relapse is the leading cause of mortality in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Among chemotherapeutics, thiopurines are key drugs in ALL combination therapy. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified relapse-specific mutations in the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 gene (PRPS1), which encodes a rate-limiting purine biosynthesis enzyme, in 24/358 (6.7%) relapsed childhood B cell ALL (B-ALL) cases. All individuals who harbored PRPS1 mutations relapsed early during treatment, and mutated ALL clones expanded exponentially before clinical relapse. Our functional analyses of PRPS1 mutants uncovered a new chemotherapy-resistance mechanism involving reduced feedback inhibition of de novo purine biosynthesis and competitive inhibition of thiopurine activation. Notably, the de novo purine synthesis inhibitor lometrexol effectively abrogated PRPS1 mutant-driven drug resistance. These results highlight the importance of constitutive activation of the de novo purine synthesis pathway in thiopurine resistance, and they offer therapeutic strategies for the treatment of relapsed and thiopurine-resistant ALL.	B	high	The study identified relapse-specific mutations in PRPS1 in 24/358 (6.7%) relapsed childhood B-ALL cases using whole-exome sequencing. This involves primary patient data from more than 5 individuals, correlating genetic findings with clinical outcomes (early relapse and thiopurine resistance). While functional analyses are mentioned, the core evidence is derived from a cohort of human patients, fitting the criteria for Level B.

Purpose This two-part, first-in-human study was initiated in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and the schedule, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of oral BGJ398, a selective FGFR1-3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Patients and Methods Adult patients were treated with escalating dosages of BGJ398 5 to 150 mg once daily or 50 mg twice daily continuously in 28-day cycles. During expansion at the MTD, patients with FGFR1-amplified squamous cell non-small-cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC; arm 1) or other solid tumors with FGFR genetic alterations (mutations/amplifications/fusions) received BGJ398 daily on a continuous schedule (arm 2), or on a 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule (arm 3). Results Data in 132 patients from the escalation and expansion arms are reported (May 15, 2015, cutoff). The MTD, 125 mg daily, was determined on the basis of dose-limiting toxicities in four patients (100 mg, grade 3 aminotransferase elevations [n = 1]; 125 mg, hyperphosphatemia [n = 1]; 150 mg, grade 1 corneal toxicity [n = 1] and grade 3 aminotransferase elevations [n = 1]). Common adverse events in patients treated at the MTD (n = 57) included hyperphosphatemia (82.5%), constipation (50.9%), decreased appetite (45.6%), and stomatitis (45.6%). A similar safety profile was observed using the 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule (RP2D). However, adverse event-related dose adjustments/interruptions were less frequent with the 3-weeks-on/1-week-off (50.0%) versus the continuous (73.7%) schedule. Antitumor activity (seven partial responses [six confirmed]) was demonstrated with BGJ398 doses ≥ 100 mg in patients with FGFR1-amplified sqNSCLC and FGFR3-mutant bladder/urothelial cancer. Conclusion BGJ398 at the MTD/RP2D had a tolerable and manageable safety profile and showed antitumor activity in several tumor types, including FGFR1-amplified sqNSCLC and FGFR3-mutant bladder/urothelial cancers.	B	high	This is a global Phase I, dose-escalation and dose-expansion clinical study involving 132 patients. It reports primary patient data, including safety profiles, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and antitumor activity, which aligns with the definition of Level B for clinical trials with more than 5 patients and statistical results.
6ce9310a-acd8-5f95-b61d-e507e65638a1	D	SF3B1 mutations constitute a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer.	Mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in RNA splicing have been found to occur at relatively high frequencies in several tumour types including myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, uveal melanoma, and pancreatic cancer, and at lower frequencies in breast cancer. To investigate whether dysfunction in RNA splicing is implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, we performed a re-analysis of published exome and whole genome sequencing data. This analysis revealed that mutations in spliceosomal component genes occurred in 5.6% of unselected breast cancers, including hotspot mutations in the SF3B1 gene, which were found in 1.8% of unselected breast cancers. SF3B1 mutations were significantly associated with ER-positive disease, AKT1 mutations, and distinct copy number alterations. Additional profiling of hotspot mutations in a panel of special histological subtypes of breast cancer showed that 16% and 6% of papillary and mucinous carcinomas of the breast harboured the SF3B1 K700E mutation. RNA sequencing identified differentially spliced events expressed in tumours with SF3B1 mutations including the protein coding genes TMEM14C, RPL31, DYNL11, UQCC, and ABCC5, and the long non-coding RNA CRNDE. Moreover, SF3B1 mutant cell lines were found to be sensitive to the SF3b complex inhibitor spliceostatin A and treatment resulted in perturbation of the splicing signature. Albeit rare, SF3B1 mutations result in alternative splicing events, and may constitute drivers and a novel therapeutic target in a subset of breast cancers.	B	high	The study involves a re-analysis of published exome and whole genome sequencing data from human breast cancer patients, identifying the prevalence of SF3B1 mutations and their associations with clinical features and other mutations. It also includes additional profiling of hotspot mutations in special histological subtypes of breast cancer and RNA sequencing of human tumors. This constitutes primary patient data analysis from a cohort larger than 5 patients, fitting the criteria for Level B. While it also includes preclinical evidence from cell lines, the primary findings regarding mutation prevalence and associations are derived from human clinical data.
b9b45787-7577-593d-aa6a-412b2a38032f	B	The MGMT promoter SNP rs16906252 is a risk factor for MGMT methylation in glioblastoma and is predictive of response to temozolomide.	BACKGROUND: Promoter methylation of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is an important predictive biomarker in glioblastoma. The T variant of the MGMT promoter-enhancer single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs16906252) has been associated with the presence of MGMT promoter methylation in other cancers. We examined the association of the T allele of rs16906252 with glioblastoma development, tumor MGMT methylation, MGMT protein expression, and survival outcomes. METHODS: Two independent temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cohorts-one Australian (Australian Genomics and Clinical Outcomes of Glioma, n = 163) and the other American (University of California Los Angeles/Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles, n = 159)-were studied. Allelic bisulphite sequencing was used to determine if methylation was specific to the T allele. Additionally, we compared the incidence of the T allele between glioblastoma cases and matched controls to assess whether it was a risk factor for developing MGMT methylated glioblastoma. RESULTS: Carriage of the T allele of the rs16906252 SNP was associated with both MGMT methylation and low MGMT protein expression and predicted significantly longer survival in temozolomide-treated patients with both MGMT methylated and nonmethylated glioblastoma. Methylation was linked to the T allele, inferring that the T variant plays a key role in the acquisition of MGMT methylation. Carriage of the T allele was associated with a significantly elevated risk of developing glioblastoma (adjusted odds ratio, 1.96; P = .013), increasing further when glioblastoma was classified by the presence of MGMT methylation (adjusted odds ratio, 2.86; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The T allele of the rs16906252 SNP is a key determinant in the acquisition of MGMT methylation in glioblastoma. Temozolomide-treated patients with the rs16906252 T genotype have better survival, irrespective of tumor methylation status.	B	high	The study involves two independent cohorts of human patients (n=163 and n=159), which constitutes primary patient data with more than 5 patients. It presents statistical results regarding associations between a SNP, MGMT methylation, and survival outcomes in temozolomide-treated glioblastoma patients, aligning with the definition of Level B clinical evidence.
ad86c224-a8b1-5137-8324-6466b93eff85	B	Cisplatin and fluorouracil with or without panitumumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SPECTRUM): an open-label phase 3 randomised trial.	BACKGROUND: Previous trials have shown that anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies can improve clinical outcomes of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). We assessed the efficacy and safety of panitumumab combined with cisplatin and fluorouracil as first-line treatment for these patients. METHODS: This open-label phase 3 randomised trial was done at 126 sites in 26 countries. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years; had histologically or cytologically confirmed SCCHN; had distant metastatic or locoregionally recurrent disease, or both, that was deemed to be incurable by surgery or radiotherapy; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less; and had adequate haematological, renal, hepatic, and cardiac function. Patients were randomly assigned according to a computer-generated randomisation sequence (1:1; stratified by previous treatment, primary tumour site, and performance status) to one of two groups. Patients in both groups received up to six 3-week cycles of intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each cycle) and fluorouracil (1000 mg/m(2) on days 1-4 of each cycle); those in the experimental group also received intravenous panitumumab (9 mg/kg on day 1 of each cycle). Patients in the experimental group could choose to continue maintenance panitumumab every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall survival and was analysed by intention to treat. In a prospectively defined retrospective analysis, we assessed tumour human papillomavirus (HPV) status as a potential predictive biomarker of outcomes with a validated p16-INK4A (henceforth, p16) immunohistochemical assay. Patients and investigators were aware of group assignment; study statisticians were masked until primary analysis; and the central laboratory assessing p16 status was masked to identification of patients and treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00460265. FINDINGS: Between May 15, 2007, and March 10, 2009, we randomly assigned 657 patients: 327 to the panitumumab group and 330 to the control group. Median overall survival was 11·1 months (95% CI 9·8-12·2) in the panitumumab group and 9·0 months (8·1-11·2) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·873, 95% CI 0·729-1·046; p=0·1403). Median progression-free survival was 5·8 months (95% CI 5·6-6·6) in the panitumumab group and 4·6 months (4·1-5·4) in the control group (HR 0·780, 95% CI 0·659-0·922; p=0·0036). Several grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent in the panitumumab group than in the control group: skin or eye toxicity (62 [19%] of 325 included in safety analyses vs six [2%] of 325), diarrhoea (15 [5%] vs four [1%]), hypomagnesaemia (40 [12%] vs 12 [4%]), hypokalaemia (33 [10%] vs 23 [7%]), and dehydration (16 [5%] vs seven [2%]). Treatment-related deaths occurred in 14 patients (4%) in the panitumumab group and eight (2%) in the control group. Five (2%) of the fatal adverse events in the panitumumab group were attributed to the experimental agent. We had appropriate samples to assess p16 status for 443 (67%) patients, of whom 99 (22%) were p16 positive. Median overall survival in patients with p16-negative tumours was longer in the panitumumab group than in the control group (11·7 months [95% CI 9·7-13·7] vs 8·6 months [6·9-11·1]; HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·58-0·93]; p=0·0115), but this difference was not shown for p16-positive patients (11·0 months [7·3-12·9] vs 12·6 months [7·7-17·4]; 1·00 [0·62-1·61]; p=0·998). In the control group, p16-positive patients had numerically, but not statistically, longer overall survival than did p16-negative patients (HR 0·70 [95% CI 0·47-1·04]). INTERPRETATION: Although the addition of panitumumab to chemotherapy did not improve overall survival in an unselected population of patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN, it improved progression-free survival and had an acceptable toxicity profile. p16 status could be a prognostic and predictive marker in patients treated with panitumumab and chemotherapy. Prospective assessment will be necessary to validate our biomarker findings. FUNDING: Amgen Inc.	A	high	The publication describes an 'open-label phase 3 randomised trial' involving 657 patients.

The EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4)-ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) fusion-type tyrosine kinase is an oncoprotein found in 4 to 5% of non-small-cell lung cancers, and clinical trials of specific inhibitors of ALK for the treatment of such tumors are currently under way. Here, we report the discovery of two secondary mutations within the kinase domain of EML4-ALK in tumor cells isolated from a patient during the relapse phase of treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Each mutation developed independently in subclones of the tumor and conferred marked resistance to two different ALK inhibitors. (Funded by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan, and others.).

148845a7-0a06-563f-adbf-eca0ff402ad3	C	Sustained response of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma treated with trastuzumab and capecitabine.	BACKGROUND: Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is a rare histologic subtype of salivary gland cancer with an overall poor prognosis. Limited histopathologic analyses have shown that some such tumors exhibit significant HER2/neu immunoreactivity, suggesting a potential role for HER2-based therapy. We report here a case of a 58-year old man with metastatic carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma who achieved a sustained long term response to combination therapy with trastuzumab and capecitabine. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58 year old man presented with T1N2bM0 carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma and underwent surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Multiple metastases to bone were documented one year later. Since the original tumor was strongly HER2/neu positive by immunohistochemistry, the patient was treated with trastuzumab, capecitabine, and zoledronic acid. He experienced total resolution of symptoms and repeat FDG-PET scan after three cycles revealed interval disease resolution. Continued treatment has resulted in maintenance of disease control for over 2 years. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the successful long term treatment of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma with targeted therapy with trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy. In the absence of definitive clinical trials which are unlikely to be performed due to the rarity of this tumor, case reports such as this one suggest potential utility for trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of HER2/neu-overexpressing carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.	C	high	The abstract explicitly states, 'We report here a case of a 58-year old man...' and 'This case illustrates the successful long term treatment...', clearly indicating a single patient case report.

ace6a140-cd2c-56b1-bd3d-e068db31fa62	C	Detection of BCR-ABL mutations in patients with CML treated with imatinib is virtually always accompanied by clinical resistance, and mutations in the ATP phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) are associated with a poor prognosis.	Imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with acquired resistance commonly have detectable BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. It is unclear whether patients who remain sensitive to imatinib also have a significant incidence of mutations. We evaluated 144 patients treated with imatinib for BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing of 40 accelerated phase (AP), 64 late chronic phase (> or = 12 months from diagnosis, late-CP), and 40 early-CP patients. Mutations were detected in 27 patients at 17 different residues, 13 (33%) of 40 in AP, 14 (22%) of 64 in late-CP, and 0 of 40 in early-CP. Acquired resistance was evident in 24 (89%) of 27 patients with mutations. Twelve (92%) of 13 patients with mutations in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding loop (P-loop) died (median survival of 4.5 months after the mutation was detected). In contrast, only 3 (21%) of 14 patients with mutations outside the P-loop died (median follow-up of 11 months). As the detection of mutations was strongly associated with imatinib resistance, we analyzed features that predicted for their detection. Patients who commenced imatinib more than 4 years from diagnosis had a significantly higher incidence of mutations (18 [41%] of 44) compared with those treated within 4 years (9 [9%] of 100), P <.0001. Lack of a major cytogenetic response (MCR) was also associated with a higher likelihood of detecting a mutation; 19 (38%) of 50 patients without a MCR had mutations compared with 8 (8.5%) of 94 with an MCR, P <.0001. In conclusion, the detection of kinase domain mutations using a direct sequencing technique was almost always associated with imatinib resistance, and patients with mutations in the P-loop had a particularly poor prognosis.	B	high	The study involves a cohort of 144 human patients, providing primary patient data with statistical results (percentages, P-values, median survival).

Bosutinib, a dual Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has shown potent activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This phase 1/2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily bosutinib 500 mg in leukemia patients after resistance/intolerance to imatinib. The current analysis included 118 patients with chronic-phase CML who had been pretreated with imatinib followed by dasatinib and/or nilotinib, with a median follow-up of 28.5 months. In this subpopulation, major cytogenetic response was attained by 32% of patients; complete cytogenetic response was attained by 24%, including in one of 3 patients treated with 3 prior TKIs. Complete hematologic response was achieved/maintained in 73% of patients. On-treatment transformation to accelerated/blast phase occurred in 5 patients. At 2 years, Kaplan-Meier-estimated progression-free survival was 73% and estimated overall survival was 83%. Responses were seen across Bcr-Abl mutations, including those associated with dasatinib and nilotinib resistance, except T315I. Bosutinib had an acceptable safety profile; treatment-emergent adverse events were primarily manageable grade 1/2 gastrointestinal events and rash. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic adverse events (> 2% of patients) included diarrhea (8%) and rash (4%). Bosutinib may offer a new treatment option for patients with chronic-phase CML after treatment with multiple TKIs. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00261846.

62f24922-0cec-54cf-8c98-fd9501b5b01f	C	Dasatinib induces significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase.	Treatment options are limited for patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-AP). Dasatinib is a novel, potent, oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC-family kinases that showed marked efficacy in a phase 1 trial of patients with imatinib-resistant CML. Results are presented for 107 patients with CML-AP with imatinib-resistance or -intolerance from a phase 2, open-label study further evaluating dasatinib efficacy and safety. At 8 months' minimum follow-up, 81%, 64%, and 39% of patients achieved overall, major (MaHR), and complete hematologic responses, respectively, whereas 33% and 24% attained major and complete cytogenetic remission. Of 69 patients who achieved MaHR, 7 progressed. Seventy-six percent of patients are estimated to be alive and progression-free at 10 months. Response rates for the 60% of patients with baseline BCR-ABL mutations did not differ from the total population. Dasatinib was well tolerated: most nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate; no imatinib-intolerant patients discontinued dasatinib because of AEs. Although common (76% of patients with severe neutropenia), cytopenias were manageable through dose modification. In summary, dasatinib induced significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance, was well tolerated, and may represent a potent new therapeutic option for CML-AP. Further follow-up is warranted. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #CA180005.	B	high	The abstract describes a Phase 2, open-label clinical study involving 107 patients.

f4bae7e4-feda-56ee-ba15-09c8bfb86335	D	MEK1 mutations confer resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibition.	Genetic alterations that activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway occur commonly in cancer. For example, the majority of melanomas harbor mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which are predicted to confer enhanced sensitivity to pharmacologic MAP kinase inhibition (e.g., RAF or MEK inhibitors). We investigated the clinical relevance of MEK dependency in melanoma by massively parallel sequencing of resistant clones generated from a MEK1 random mutagenesis screen in vitro, as well as tumors obtained from relapsed patients following treatment with AZD6244, an allosteric MEK inhibitor. Most mutations conferring resistance to MEK inhibition in vitro populated the allosteric drug binding pocket or alpha-helix C and showed robust ( approximately 100-fold) resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition. Other mutations affected MEK1 codons located within or abutting the N-terminal negative regulatory helix (helix A), which also undergo gain-of-function germline mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. One such mutation, MEK1(P124L), was identified in a resistant metastatic focus that emerged in a melanoma patient treated with AZD6244. Both MEK1(P124L) and MEK1(Q56P), which disrupts helix A, conferred cross-resistance to PLX4720, a selective B-RAF inhibitor. However, exposing BRAF-mutant melanoma cells to AZD6244 and PLX4720 in combination prevented emergence of resistant clones. These results affirm the importance of MEK dependency in BRAF-mutant melanoma and suggest novel mechanisms of resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibitors that may have important clinical implications.	C	high	The study primarily involves preclinical in vitro models (random mutagenesis screen, melanoma cells) but also includes analysis of tumors from relapsed patients. A key finding, the MEK1(P124L) mutation, was identified in a resistant metastatic focus from 'a melanoma patient,' which constitutes a case study or a very small patient series (if 'relapsed patients' refers to a small, unquantified cohort). This direct human observation, even if limited to a single or very few patients, elevates the evidence beyond purely preclinical (Level D).
1d46d09f-5411-5871-b6f0-ce5b6b3d4075	B	Randomized Phase III Study Comparing Gefitinib With Erlotinib in Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma: WJOG 5108L.	PURPOSE: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase has been an important target for non-small-cell lung cancer. Several EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are currently approved, and both gefitinib and erlotinib are the most well-known first-generation EGFR-TKIs. This randomized phase III study was conducted to investigate the difference between these two EGFR-TKIs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously treated patients with lung adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to receive gefitinib or erlotinib. This study aimed to investigate the noninferiority of gefitinib compared with erlotinib. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Five hundred sixty-one patients were randomly assigned, including 401 patients (71.7%) with EGFR mutation. All baseline factors (except performance status) were balanced between the arms. Median PFS and overall survival times for gefitinib and erlotinib were 6.5 and 7.5 months (hazard ratio [HR], 1.125; 95% CI, 0.940 to 1.347; P = .257) and 22.8 and 24.5 months (HR, 1.038; 95% CI, 0.833 to 1.294; P = .768), respectively. The response rates for gefitinib and erlotinib were 45.9% and 44.1%, respectively. Median PFS times in EGFR mutation-positive patients receiving gefitinib versus erlotinib were 8.3 and 10.0 months, respectively (HR, 1.093; 95% CI, 0.879 to 1.358; P = .424). The primary grade 3 or 4 toxicities were rash (2.2% for gefitinib v 18.1% for erlotinib) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation (6.1%/13.0% for gefitinib v 2.2%/3.3% for erlotinib). CONCLUSION: The study did not demonstrate noninferiority of gefitinib compared with erlotinib in terms of PFS in patients with lung adenocarcinoma according to the predefined criteria.

3f49b91f-edc0-58d9-9063-f27483f7da63	C	Dasatinib in imatinib-resistant Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias.	BACKGROUND: The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is effective in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) leukemias, but relapse occurs, mainly as a result of the outgrowth of leukemic subclones with imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations. We evaluated dasatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor that targets most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Patients with various phases of CML or with Ph-positive ALL who could not tolerate or were resistant to imatinib were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation study. Dasatinib (15 to 240 mg per day) was administered orally in four-week treatment cycles, once or twice daily. RESULTS: A complete hematologic response was achieved in 37 of 40 patients with chronic-phase CML, and major hematologic responses were seen in 31 of 44 patients with accelerated-phase CML, CML with blast crisis, or Ph-positive ALL. In these two phases, the rates of major cytogenetic response were 45 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Responses were maintained in 95 percent of patients with chronic-phase disease and in 82 percent of patients with accelerated-phase disease, with a median follow-up more than 12 months and 5 months, respectively. Nearly all patients with lymphoid blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL had a relapse within six months. Responses occurred among all BCR-ABL genotypes, with the exception of the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to both dasatinib and imatinib in vitro. Myelosuppression was common but not dose-limiting. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib induces hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with CML or Ph-positive ALL who cannot tolerate or are resistant to imatinib. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00064233 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).	B	high	The abstract describes a 'phase 1 dose-escalation study' involving a significant number of human patients (e.g., 40 patients with chronic-phase CML, 44 patients with accelerated-phase CML, CML with blast crisis, or Ph-positive ALL) and presents statistical results regarding hematologic and cytogenetic responses. This directly aligns with the definition of Level B, which includes clinical trials (Phase I–III) or primary patient data with >5 patients and statistical results.
ace6a140-cd2c-56b1-bd3d-e068db31fa62	C	Detection of BCR-ABL mutations in patients with CML treated with imatinib is virtually always accompanied by clinical resistance, and mutations in the ATP phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) are associated with a poor prognosis.	Imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with acquired resistance commonly have detectable BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. It is unclear whether patients who remain sensitive to imatinib also have a significant incidence of mutations. We evaluated 144 patients treated with imatinib for BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing of 40 accelerated phase (AP), 64 late chronic phase (> or = 12 months from diagnosis, late-CP), and 40 early-CP patients. Mutations were detected in 27 patients at 17 different residues, 13 (33%) of 40 in AP, 14 (22%) of 64 in late-CP, and 0 of 40 in early-CP. Acquired resistance was evident in 24 (89%) of 27 patients with mutations. Twelve (92%) of 13 patients with mutations in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding loop (P-loop) died (median survival of 4.5 months after the mutation was detected). In contrast, only 3 (21%) of 14 patients with mutations outside the P-loop died (median follow-up of 11 months). As the detection of mutations was strongly associated with imatinib resistance, we analyzed features that predicted for their detection. Patients who commenced imatinib more than 4 years from diagnosis had a significantly higher incidence of mutations (18 [41%] of 44) compared with those treated within 4 years (9 [9%] of 100), P <.0001. Lack of a major cytogenetic response (MCR) was also associated with a higher likelihood of detecting a mutation; 19 (38%) of 50 patients without a MCR had mutations compared with 8 (8.5%) of 94 with an MCR, P <.0001. In conclusion, the detection of kinase domain mutations using a direct sequencing technique was almost always associated with imatinib resistance, and patients with mutations in the P-loop had a particularly poor prognosis.	B	high	The study evaluates 144 human patients treated with imatinib, providing primary patient data and statistical results regarding the association between BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, imatinib resistance, and prognosis. This aligns with Level B, which includes clinical trials or primary patient data with more than 5 patients and statistical results.
f0b020ce-1085-54d3-916b-531c4b20cb47	D	Activating mutations in the NT5C2 nucleotidase gene drive chemotherapy resistance in relapsed ALL.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of lymphoid progenitors. Despite intensive chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric patients and over 50% of adult patients with ALL do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge in the treatment of this disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identify mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2), which encodes a 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse T cell ALLs and 1/35 (3%) relapse B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts. These results support a prominent role for activating mutations in NT5C2 and increased nucleoside-analog metabolism in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance in ALL.	B	high	The study identifies mutations in the NT5C2 gene using whole-exome sequencing in a cohort of 138 relapse ALL patient samples (103 T cell ALLs and 35 B-precursor ALLs). This constitutes primary patient data with a sample size greater than 5 patients, which aligns with the definition of Level B (Clinical Evidence). While the abstract also mentions in vitro experiments, the primary finding of mutations in patient samples drives the classification to Level B.
1b32729f-a041-5c69-a2fe-3cf30faf7e2d	B	Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (ToGA): a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also known as ERBB2), was investigated in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. METHODS: ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) was an open-label, international, phase 3, randomised controlled trial undertaken in 122 centres in 24 countries. Patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer were eligible for inclusion if their tumours showed overexpression of HER2 protein by immunohistochemistry or gene amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a chemotherapy regimen consisting of capecitabine plus cisplatin or fluorouracil plus cisplatin given every 3 weeks for six cycles or chemotherapy in combination with intravenous trastuzumab. Allocation was by block randomisation stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, chemotherapy regimen, extent of disease, primary cancer site, and measurability of disease, implemented with a central interactive voice recognition system. The primary endpoint was overall survival in all randomised patients who received study medication at least once. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01041404. FINDINGS: 594 patients were randomly assigned to study treatment (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=298; chemotherapy alone, n=296), of whom 584 were included in the primary analysis (n=294; n=290). Median follow-up was 18.6 months (IQR 11-25) in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group and 17.1 months (9-25) in the chemotherapy alone group. Median overall survival was 13.8 months (95% CI 12-16) in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with 11.1 months (10-13) in those assigned to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.60-0.91; p=0.0046). The most common adverse events in both groups were nausea (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, 197 [67%] vs chemotherapy alone, 184 [63%]), vomiting (147 [50%] vs 134 [46%]), and neutropenia (157 [53%] vs 165 [57%]). Rates of overall grade 3 or 4 adverse events (201 [68%] vs 198 [68%]) and cardiac adverse events (17 [6%] vs 18 [6%]) did not differ between groups. INTERPRETATION: Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy can be considered as a new standard option for patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche.	A	high	The publication describes a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial with a large patient cohort (594 patients). The results show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival and the interpretation suggests it can be considered a new standard option, which aligns with the definition of 'practice-changing evidence' and 'Phase III clinical trials' for Level A.
102526d2-1b3a-5426-b8a0-ddcf0b22f1d4	D	PF00299804, an irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor, is effective in lung cancer models with EGFR and ERBB2 mutations that are resistant to gefitinib.	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib are effective treatments for a subset of non-small cell lung cancers. In particular, cancers with specific EGFR-activating mutations seem to be the most sensitive to these agents. However, despite their initial response, such cancers almost invariably develop resistance. In 50% of such cancers, a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, has been identified that renders gefitinib and erlotinib ineffective inhibitors of EGFR kinase activity. Thus, there is a clinical need to develop novel EGFR inhibitors that can effectively inactivate T790M-containing EGFR proteins. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of a novel compound, PF00299804, an irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor. The results from these studies show that PF00299804 is a potent inhibitor of EGFR-activating mutations as well as the EGFR T790M resistance mutation both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, PF00299804 is a highly effective inhibitor of both the wild-type ERBB2 and the gefitinib-resistant oncogenic ERBB2 mutation identified in lung cancers. These preclinical evaluations support further clinical development of PF00299804 for cancers with mutations and/or amplifications of ERBB family members.	D	high	The abstract explicitly states that the study evaluates the compound 'both in vitro and in vivo' and refers to the findings as 'preclinical evaluations'. This indicates the research was conducted using laboratory models (e.g., cell lines, animal models) rather than direct human clinical data.
2a83ba12-8e19-5dca-87e5-1d89fabdb170	D	Comparison of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and INNO-406 in imatinib-resistant cell lines.	We compared the growth-inhibitory effects and inhibition profile of the SRC family kinases (SFKs) of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and INNO-406. Dasatinib exhibited the strongest potency against BCR-ABL with little selectivity over SFKs. Nilotinib exhibited a weaker affinity than the other inhibitors, but was highly specific for ABL and may be useful for the treatment of P-glycoprotein overexpressing leukemic cells. INNO-406 had an intermediate affinity for BCR-ABL between that of dasatinib and nilotinib, and inhibited only SFKs LCK and LYN among SFKs. Both nilotinib and INNO-406 were potent inhibitors of the dasatinib-resistant T315A, F317L and F317V BCR-ABL mutations.	D	high	The study explicitly states that it compares the effects of drugs in 'imatinib-resistant cell lines' and investigates 'growth-inhibitory effects' and 'inhibition profile'. This indicates an in vitro study, which falls under preclinical evidence.
2563d7b8-b1e5-50bf-810d-6f3768fc4001	A	Olaparib for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Multiple loss-of-function alterations in genes that are involved in DNA repair, including homologous recombination repair, are associated with response to poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition in patients with prostate and other cancers. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluating the PARP inhibitor olaparib in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent (e.g., enzalutamide or abiraterone). All the men had a qualifying alteration in prespecified genes with a direct or indirect role in homologous recombination repair. Cohort A (245 patients) had at least one alteration in <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, or <i>ATM</i>; cohort B (142 patients) had alterations in any of 12 other prespecified genes, prospectively and centrally determined from tumor tissue. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive olaparib or the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone (control). The primary end point was imaging-based progression-free survival in cohort A according to blinded independent central review. RESULTS: In cohort A, imaging-based progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the control group (median, 7.4 months vs. 3.6 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.47; P<0.001); a significant benefit was also observed with respect to the confirmed objective response rate and the time to pain progression. The median overall survival in cohort A was 18.5 months in the olaparib group and 15.1 months in the control group; 81% of the patients in the control group who had progression crossed over to receive olaparib. A significant benefit for olaparib was also seen for imaging-based progression-free survival in the overall population (cohorts A and B). Anemia and nausea were the main toxic effects in patients who received olaparib. CONCLUSIONS: In men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone and who had alterations in genes with a role in homologous recombination repair, olaparib was associated with longer progression-free survival and better measures of response and patient-reported end points than either enzalutamide or abiraterone. (Funded by AstraZeneca and Merck Sharp & Dohme; PROfound ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02987543.).	A	high	The publication describes a randomized, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and other clinical endpoints with olaparib. Phase 3 trials with definitive positive results are considered Level A evidence, often leading to practice changes.
484baf50-dfd4-5997-b7d2-7d754f625792	D	Activating mutations in ALK provide a therapeutic target in neuroblastoma.	Neuroblastoma, an embryonal tumour of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, accounts for approximately 15% of all deaths due to childhood cancer. High-risk neuroblastomas are rapidly progressive; even with intensive myeloablative chemotherapy, relapse is common and almost uniformly fatal. Here we report the detection of previously unknown mutations in the ALK gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, in 8% of primary neuroblastomas. Five non-synonymous sequence variations were identified in the kinase domain of ALK, of which three were somatic and two were germ line. The most frequent mutation, F1174L, was also identified in three different neuroblastoma cell lines. ALK complementary DNAs encoding the F1174L and R1275Q variants, but not the wild-type ALK cDNA, transformed interleukin-3-dependent murine haematopoietic Ba/F3 cells to cytokine-independent growth. Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutations were sensitive to the small-molecule inhibitor of ALK, TAE684 (ref. 4). Furthermore, two human neuroblastoma cell lines harbouring the F1174L mutation were also sensitive to the inhibitor. Cytotoxicity was associated with increased amounts of apoptosis as measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of ALK expression in neuroblastoma cell lines with the F1174L mutation also resulted in apoptosis and impaired cell proliferation. Thus, activating alleles of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase are present in primary neuroblastoma tumours and in established neuroblastoma cell lines, and confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition with small molecules, providing a molecular rationale for targeted therapy of this disease.	D	high	The study identifies ALK mutations in primary neuroblastoma samples (human data), but the evidence for ALK as a 'therapeutic target' is derived from in vitro experiments using murine hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells and human neuroblastoma cell lines. These experiments demonstrate sensitivity to ALK inhibitors and the impact of ALK knockdown on cell proliferation and apoptosis, which are all preclinical models.
b544bd80-6b2f-5cfd-8cbf-ba9ab4ec7708	D	Ponatinib inhibits polyclonal drug-resistant KIT oncoproteins and shows therapeutic potential in heavily pretreated gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients.	PURPOSE: KIT is the major oncogenic driver of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib are approved therapies; however, efficacy is often limited by the acquisition of polyclonal secondary resistance mutations in KIT, with those located in the activation (A) loop (exons 17/18) being particularly problematic. Here, we explore the KIT-inhibitory activity of ponatinib in preclinical models and describe initial characterization of its activity in patients with GIST. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cellular and in vivo activities of ponatinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib against mutant KIT were evaluated using an accelerated mutagenesis assay and a panel of engineered and GIST-derived cell lines. The ponatinib-KIT costructure was also determined. The clinical activity of ponatinib was examined in three patients with GIST previously treated with all three FDA-approved agents. RESULTS: In engineered and GIST-derived cell lines, ponatinib potently inhibited KIT exon 11 primary mutants and a range of secondary mutants, including those within the A-loop. Ponatinib also induced regression in engineered and GIST-derived tumor models containing these secondary mutations. In a mutagenesis screen, 40 nmol/L ponatinib was sufficient to suppress outgrowth of all secondary mutants except V654A, which was suppressed at 80 nmol/L. This inhibitory profile could be rationalized on the basis of structural analyses. Ponatinib (30 mg daily) displayed encouraging clinical activity in two of three patients with GIST. CONCLUSION: Ponatinib possesses potent activity against most major clinically relevant KIT mutants and has demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity in patients with refractory GIST. These data strongly support further evaluation of ponatinib in patients with GIST.	C	high	The study includes both preclinical evidence (in vitro and in vivo models) and clinical observations. The clinical component involves a very small patient series of three individuals, which falls under the definition of Level C (Case Study: case reports or very small patient series <5 patients). While preclinical data is present, the direct human observation, even in a limited number of patients, represents the highest level of evidence in this publication.
20744627-d206-5ab8-a417-c763750dfbef	D	Axitinib effectively inhibits BCR-ABL1(T315I) with a distinct binding conformation.	The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is a driver oncogene in chronic myeloid leukaemia and 30-50% of cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Introduction of ABL1 kinase inhibitors (for example, imatinib) has markedly improved patient survival, but acquired drug resistance remains a challenge. Point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain weaken inhibitor binding and represent the most common clinical resistance mechanism. The BCR-ABL1 kinase domain gatekeeper mutation Thr315Ile (T315I) confers resistance to all approved ABL1 inhibitors except ponatinib, which has toxicity limitations. Here we combine comprehensive drug sensitivity and resistance profiling of patient cells ex vivo with structural analysis to establish the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a selective and effective inhibitor for T315I-mutant BCR-ABL1-driven leukaemia. Axitinib potently inhibited BCR-ABL1(T315I), at both biochemical and cellular levels, by binding to the active form of ABL1(T315I) in a mutation-selective binding mode. These findings suggest that the T315I mutation shifts the conformational equilibrium of the kinase in favour of an active (DFG-in) A-loop conformation, which has more optimal binding interactions with axitinib. Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unexpected opportunity to repurpose axitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug approved for renal cancer, as an inhibitor for ABL1 gatekeeper mutant drug-resistant leukaemia patients. This study shows that wild-type proteins do not always sample the conformations available to disease-relevant mutant proteins and that comprehensive drug testing of patient-derived cells can identify unpredictable, clinically significant drug-repositioning opportunities.	C	high	The abstract describes 'Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow.' This indicates a single patient case report, which falls under the definition of Level C (Case Study: case reports or very small patient series <5 patients). While there is also preclinical evidence (ex vivo patient cells, biochemical and cellular levels), the direct observation in a human patient, even if singular, elevates it beyond purely preclinical evidence.
3cdb8e92-e650-555e-b59b-e544c17e5bd1	C	Safety and efficacy of bosutinib (SKI-606) in chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia patients with resistance or intolerance to imatinib.	Bosutinib, a dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, has shown potent activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this phase 1/2 study we evaluated bosutinib in patients with chronic phase imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study to determine the recommended starting dose for part 2; part 2 evaluated the efficacy and safety of bosutinib 500 mg once-daily dosing. The study enrolled 288 patients with imatinib-resistant (n = 200) or imatinib-intolerant (n = 88) CML and no other previous kinase inhibitor exposure. At 24 weeks, 31% of patients achieved major cytogenetic response (primary end point). After a median follow-up of 24.2 months, 86% of patients achieved complete hematologic remission, 53% had a major cytogenetic response (41% had a complete cytogenetic response), and 64% of those achieving complete cytogenetic response had a major molecular response. At 2 years, progression-free survival was 79%; overall survival at 2 years was 92%. Responses were seen across Bcr-Abl mutants, except T315I. Bosutinib exhibited an acceptable safety profile; the most common treatment-emergent adverse event was mild/moderate, typically self-limiting diarrhea. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic adverse events (> 2% of patients) included diarrhea (9%), rash (9%), and vomiting (3%). These data suggest bosutinib is effective and tolerable in patients with chronic phase imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML. This trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00261846.	B	high	The abstract describes a Phase 1/2 clinical trial involving 288 patients, providing primary patient data with statistical results on efficacy and safety.

138242eb-4953-5a1a-8480-5ea2db44b832	B	Dabrafenib in patients with melanoma, untreated brain metastases, and other solid tumours: a phase 1 dose-escalation trial.	BACKGROUND: Dabrafenib is an inhibitor of BRAF kinase that is selective for mutant BRAF. We aimed to assess its safety and tolerability and to establish a recommended phase 2 dose in patients with incurable solid tumours, especially those with melanoma and untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases. METHODS: We undertook a phase 1 trial between May 27, 2009, and March 20, 2012, at eight study centres in Australia and the USA. Eligible patients had incurable solid tumours, were 18 years or older, and had adequate organ function. BRAF mutations were mandatory for inclusion later in the study because of an absence of activity in patients with wild-type BRAF. We used an accelerated dose titration method, with the first dose cohort receiving 12 mg dabrafenib daily in a 21-day cycle. Once doses had been established, we expanded the cohorts to include up to 20 patients. On the basis of initial data, we chose a recommended phase 2 dose. Efficacy at the recommended phase 2 dose was studied in patients with BRAF-mutant tumours, including those with non-Val600Glu mutations, in three cohorts: metastatic melanoma, melanoma with untreated brain metastases, and non-melanoma solid tumours. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00880321. FINDINGS: We enrolled 184 patients, of whom 156 had metastatic melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 2 or worse were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (20 patients, 11%), fatigue (14, 8%), and pyrexia (11, 6%). Dose reductions were necessary in 13 (7%) patients. No deaths or discontinuations resulted from adverse events, and 140 (76%) patients had no treatment-related adverse events worse than grade 2. Doses were increased to 300 mg twice daily, with no maximum tolerated dose recorded. On the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic, and response data, we selected a recommended phase 2 dose of 150 mg twice daily. At the recommended phase 2 dose in 36 patients with Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were reported in 25 (69%, 95% CI 51·9-83·7) and confirmed responses in 18 (50%, 32·9-67·1). 21 (78%, 57·7-91·4) of 27 patients with Val600Glu BRAF-mutant melanoma responded and 15 (56%, 35·3-74·5) had a confirmed response. In Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were durable, with 17 patients (47%) on treatment for more than 6 months. Responses were recorded in patients with non-Val600Glu BRAF mutations. In patients with melanoma and untreated brain metastases, nine of ten patients had reductions in size of brain lesions. In 28 patients with BRAF-mutant non-melanoma solid tumours, apparent antitumour activity was noted in a gastrointestinal stromal tumour, papillary thyroid cancers, non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer. INTERPRETATION: Dabrafenib is safe in patients with solid tumours, and an active inhibitor of Val600-mutant BRAF with responses noted in patients with melanoma, brain metastases, and other solid tumours. FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.	B	high	This is a Phase 1 clinical trial involving 184 patients, which is well above the 5-patient threshold for Level B.

d7cade64-10d9-56f9-a681-31387f884106	A	Larotrectinib in patients with TRK fusion-positive solid tumours: a pooled analysis of three phase 1/2 clinical trials.	BACKGROUND: The selective TRK inhibitor larotrectinib was approved for paediatric and adult patients with advanced TRK fusion-positive solid tumours based on a primary analysis set of 55 patients. The aim of our analysis was to explore the efficacy and long-term safety of larotrectinib in a larger population of patients with TRK fusion-positive solid tumours. METHODS: Patients were enrolled and treated in a phase 1 adult, a phase 1/2 paediatric, or a phase 2 adolescent and adult trial. Some eligibility criteria differed between these studies. For this pooled analysis, eligible patients were aged 1 month or older, with a locally advanced or metastatic non-CNS primary, TRK fusion-positive solid tumour, who had received standard therapy previously if available. This analysis set includes the 55 patients on which approval of larotrectinib was based. Larotrectinib was administered orally (capsule or liquid formulation), on a continuous 28-day schedule, to adults mostly at a dose of 100 mg twice daily, and to paediatric patients mostly at a dose of 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (maximum of 100 mg) twice daily. The primary endpoint was objective response as assessed by local investigators in an intention-to-treat analysis. Contributing trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02122913 (active not recruiting), NCT02637687 (recruiting), and NCT02576431 (recruiting). FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2014, and Feb 19, 2019, 159 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer were enrolled and treated with larotrectinib. Ages ranged from less than 1 month to 84 years. The proportion of patients with an objective response according to investigator assessment was 121 (79%, 95% CI 72-85) of 153 evaluable patients, with 24 (16%) having complete responses. In a safety population of 260 patients treated regardless of TRK fusion status, the most common grade 3 or 4 larotrectinib-related adverse events were increased alanine aminotransferase (eight [3%] of 260 patients), anaemia (six, 2%), and decreased neutrophil count (five [2%]). The most common larotrectinib-related serious adverse events were increased alanine aminotransferase (two [<1%] of 260 patients), increased aspartate aminotransferase (two [<1%]), and nausea (two [<1%]). No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: These data confirm that TRK fusions define a unique molecular subgroup of advanced solid tumours for which larotrectinib is highly active. Safety data indicate that long-term administration of larotrectinib is feasible. FUNDING: Bayer and Loxo Oncology.	A	high	This publication is a pooled analysis of three Phase 1/2 clinical trials, involving a large cohort of patients (159 for efficacy, 260 for safety). The abstract explicitly states that the selective TRK inhibitor larotrectinib was already approved based on a primary analysis set of 55 patients from these trials. This pooled analysis further confirms the high activity and long-term safety of an already FDA-approved treatment, thus providing robust, practice-changing evidence that solidifies a 'validated association' in human medicine.
a1d7e47a-2d03-5a15-80b8-a961c18b3f8a	C	Effectiveness of EGFR-TKIs in a Patient with Lung Adenocarcinoma Harboring an <i>EGFR-RAD51</i> Fusion.	Epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR</i>) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have become the first choice for patients with sensitive mutations and have significantly improved prognosis. <i>EGFR</i> exon 19 deletions and L858R mutation in exon 21 are the most common sensitive mutations in lung adenocarcinoma. With advances in detection technology, some rare variants of <i>EGFR</i> have been detected, including <i>EGFR</i> kinase domain duplications and <i>EGFR</i> fusions. Only a few reports have revealed the effectiveness of EGFR-TKIs in patients with these rare variants. In this study, we report a case of <i>EGFR-RAD51</i> fusion in lung adenocarcinoma that showed a response to icotinib; these findings provide additional support for the use of EGFR-TKIs for patients with these atypical variants. KEY POINTS: A young patient with lung adenocarcinoma harboring a rare <i>EGFR-RAD51</i> fusion who responded to icotinib with a PFS of longer than 15 months.All reported <i>EGFR-RAD51</i> fusions have the same breakpoints and show responses to EGFR-TKIs including icotinib, except for one patient who responded to chemotherapy.Although <i>EGFR</i> fusion is a rare <i>EGFR</i> variant type, the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs suggests the necessity for new detection technology, such as NGS, for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.The clinical usage of NGS could maximize the benefits of precision medicine in patients with cancer.The current case provides new evidence for the efficacy of icotinib in patients with the rare <i>EGFR-RAD51</i> fusion and <i>EGFR</i>-activating mutations.	C	high	The abstract explicitly states, 'In this study, we report a case of EGFR-RAD51 fusion in lung adenocarcinoma...' and 'A young patient with lung adenocarcinoma harboring a rare EGFR-RAD51 fusion who responded to icotinib...'

Neomorphic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are driver mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers. We report the development of new allosteric inhibitors of mutant IDH1. Crystallographic and biochemical results demonstrated that compounds of this chemical series bind to an allosteric site and lock the enzyme in a catalytically inactive conformation, thereby enabling inhibition of different clinically relevant IDH1 mutants. Treatment of IDH1 mutant primary AML cells uniformly led to a decrease in intracellular 2-HG, abrogation of the myeloid differentiation block and induction of granulocytic differentiation at the level of leukemic blasts and more immature stem-like cells, in vitro and in vivo. Molecularly, treatment with the inhibitors led to a reversal of the DNA cytosine hypermethylation patterns caused by mutant IDH1 in the cells of individuals with AML. Our study provides proof of concept for the molecular and biological activity of novel allosteric inhibitors for targeting different mutant forms of IDH1 in leukemia.	D	high	The abstract describes the development of new inhibitors and demonstrates their activity using crystallographic, biochemical, in vitro, and in vivo models. While it mentions 'primary AML cells' and 'cells of individuals with AML,' these are used in laboratory settings ('in vitro and in vivo') to establish 'proof of concept,' not in a clinical trial involving human patients. This aligns with the definition of preclinical evidence.
8bc991f6-081f-586a-bba9-c3168bd7e7da	B	Ibrutinib in previously treated Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.	BACKGROUND: MYD88(L265P) and CXCR4(WHIM) mutations are highly prevalent in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. MYD88(L265P) triggers tumor-cell growth through Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a target of ibrutinib. CXCR4(WHIM) mutations confer in vitro resistance to ibrutinib. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of ibrutinib in 63 symptomatic patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia who had received at least one previous treatment, and we investigated the effect of MYD88 and CXCR4 mutations on outcomes. Ibrutinib at a daily dose of 420 mg was administered orally until disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxic effects. RESULTS: After the patients received ibrutinib, median serum IgM levels decreased from 3520 mg per deciliter to 880 mg per deciliter, median hemoglobin levels increased from 10.5 g per deciliter to 13.8 g per deciliter, and bone marrow involvement decreased from 60% to 25% (P<0.01 for all comparisons). The median time to at least a minor response was 4 weeks. The overall response rate was 90.5%, and the major response rate was 73.0%; these rates were highest among patients with MYD88(L265P)CXCR4(WT) (with WT indicating wild-type) (100% overall response rate and 91.2% major response rate), followed by patients with MYD88(L265P)CXCR4(WHIM) (85.7% and 61.9%, respectively) and patients with MYD88(WT)CXCR4(WT) (71.4% and 28.6%). The estimated 2-year progression-free and overall survival rates among all patients were 69.1% and 95.2%, respectively. Treatment-related toxic effects of grade 2 or higher included neutropenia (in 22% of the patients) and thrombocytopenia (in 14%), which were more common in heavily pretreated patients; postprocedural bleeding (in 3%); epistaxis associated with the use of fish-oil supplements (in 3%); and atrial fibrillation associated with a history of arrhythmia (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib was highly active, associated with durable responses, and safe in pretreated patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. MYD88 and CXCR4 mutation status affected responses to this drug. (Funded by Pharmacyclics and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01614821.).

31057c1b-c533-542f-bcac-61446de2829c	D	What hides behind the MASC: clinical response and acquired resistance to entrectinib after ETV6-NTRK3 identification in a mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC).	BACKGROUND: Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC) is a recently described pathologic entity. We report the case of a patient with an initial diagnosis of salivary acinic cell carcinoma later reclassified as MASC after next-generation sequencing revealed an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This alteration was targeted with the pan-Trk inhibitor entrectinib (Ignyta), which possesses potent in vitro activity against cell lines containing various NTRK1/2/3 fusions. RESULTS: A dramatic and durable response was achieved with entrectinib in this patient, followed by acquired resistance that correlated with the appearance of a novel NTRK3 G623R mutation. Structural modeling predicts that this alteration sterically interferes with drug binding, correlating to decreased sensitivity to drug inhibition observed in cell-based assays. CONCLUSIONS: This first report of clinical activity with TrkC inhibition and the development of acquired resistance in an NTRK3-rearranged cancer emphasize the utility of comprehensive molecular profiling and targeted therapy for rare malignancies (NCT02097810).	C	high	"The abstract explicitly states, ""We report the case of a patient..."" and describes the clinical course, response to treatment, and acquired resistance in this single individual.

INTRODUCTION: Amrubicin is a promising agent in the treatment of lung cancer, but predictive biomarkers have not yet been described. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is an enzyme known to metabolize amrubicinol, the active metabolite of amrubicin, to an inactive compound. We examined the relationship between NQO1 and amrubicinol cytotoxicity. METHODS: Gene and protein expression of NQO1, amrubicinol cytotoxicity, and C609T single-nucleotide polymorphism of NQO1 were evaluated in 29 lung cancer cell lines: 14 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 15 non-SCLC (NSCLC). The involvement of NQO1 in amrubicinol cytotoxicity was evaluated by small interfering RNA against NQO1. RESULTS: A significant inverse relationship between both gene and protein expression of NQO1 and amrubicinol cytotoxicity was found in all cell lines. Treatment with NQO1 small interfering RNA increased amrubicinol cytotoxicity and decreased NQO1 expression in both NSCLC and SCLC cells. Furthermore, cell lines genotyped homozygous for the 609T allele showed significantly lower NQO1 protein expression and higher sensitivity for amrubicinol than those with the other genotypes in both NSCLC and SCLC cells. CONCLUSIONS: NQO1 expression is one of the major determinants for amrubicinol cytotoxicity, and C609T single-nucleotide polymorphism of NQO1 could be a predictive biomarker for response to amrubicin treatment.	D	high	The study was conducted using 29 lung cancer cell lines, which constitutes an in vitro model. This type of research is classified as preclinical evidence.
be0a1ea6-3901-51df-8c21-9949aadeea26	D	Inhibition of drug-resistant mutants of ABL, KIT, and EGF receptor kinases.	"To realize the full potential of targeted protein kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer, it is important to address the emergence of drug resistance in treated patients. Mutant forms of BCR-ABL, KIT, and the EGF receptor (EGFR) have been found that confer resistance to the drugs imatinib, gefitinib, and erlotinib. The mutations weaken or prevent drug binding, and interestingly, one of the most common sites of mutation in all three kinases is a highly conserved ""gatekeeper"" threonine residue near the kinase active site. We have identified existing clinical compounds that bind and inhibit drug-resistant mutant variants of ABL, KIT, and EGFR. We found that the Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 and the p38 inhibitor BIRB-796 inhibit the imatinib- and BMS-354825-resistant ABL(T315I) kinase. The KIT/FLT3 inhibitor SU-11248 potently inhibits the imatinib-resistant KIT(V559D/T670I) kinase, consistent with the clinical efficacy of SU-11248 against imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal tumors, and the EGFR inhibitors EKB-569 and CI-1033, but not GW-572016 and ZD-6474, potently inhibit the gefitinib- and erlotinib-resistant EGFR(L858R/T790M) kinase. EKB-569 and CI-1033 are already in clinical trials, and our results suggest that they should be considered for testing in the treatment of gefitinib/erlotinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer. The results highlight the strategy of screening existing clinical compounds against newly identified drug-resistant mutant variants to find compounds that may serve as starting points for the development of next-generation drugs, or that could be used directly to treat patients that have acquired resistance to first-generation targeted therapy."	D	high	The abstract describes identifying existing clinical compounds that 'bind and inhibit drug-resistant mutant variants of ABL, KIT, and EGFR.' The findings detail the inhibition of specific mutant kinases by various compounds. While it references existing clinical efficacy and compounds in clinical trials, the study itself presents preclinical evidence of compound activity against specific kinase mutants, which falls under in vitro or in vivo (non-human) models.
1429a0ad-e2e1-5453-b6a2-c532c880a0f0	C	Impact of baseline BCR-ABL mutations on response to nilotinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase.	PURPOSE: Nilotinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP; CML-CP) and accelerated phase (AP; CML-AP) who are resistant to or intolerant of prior imatinib therapy. In this subanalysis of a phase II study of nilotinib in patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML-CP, the occurrence and impact of baseline and newly detectable BCR-ABL mutations were assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Baseline mutation data were assessed in 281 (88%) of 321 patients with CML-CP in the phase II nilotinib registration trial. RESULTS: Among imatinib-resistant patients, the frequency of mutations at baseline was 55%. After 12 months of therapy, major cytogenetic response (MCyR) was achieved in 60%, complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in 40%, and major molecular response (MMR) in 29% of patients without baseline mutations versus 49% (P = .145), 32% (P = .285), and 22% (P = .366), respectively, of patients with mutations. Responses in patients who harbored mutations with high in vitro sensitivity to nilotinib (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] <or= 150 nM) or mutations with unknown nilotinib sensitivity were equivalent to those responses for patients without mutations (not significant). Patients with mutations that were less sensitive to nilotinib in vitro (IC(50) > 150 nM; Y253H, E255V/K, F359V/C) had less favorable responses, as 13%, 43%, and 9% of patients with each of these mutations, respectively, achieved MCyR; none achieved CCyR. CONCLUSION: For most patients with imatinib resistance and with mutations, nilotinib offers a substantial probability of response. However, mutational status at baseline may influence response. Less sensitive mutations that occurred at three residues defined in this study, as well as the T315I mutation, may be associated with less favorable responses to nilotinib.	B	high	This publication is a subanalysis of a Phase II clinical trial involving 281 human patients. It presents primary patient data with statistical results on the impact of baseline mutations on response to nilotinib, which aligns with the definition of Level B (Clinical Evidence).
05dfc1ae-27e7-5005-bbd3-2cf1f23b1073	B	Activity of the oral MEK inhibitor trametinib in patients with advanced melanoma: a phase 1 dose-escalation trial.	BACKGROUND: MEK is a member of the MAPK signalling cascade that is commonly activated in melanoma. Direct inhibition of MEK blocks cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. We aimed to analyse safety, efficacy, and genotyping data for the oral, small-molecule MEK inhibitor trametinib in patients with melanoma. METHODS: We undertook a multicentre, phase 1 three-part study (dose escalation, cohort expansion, and pharmacodynamic assessment). The main results of this study are reported elsewhere; here we present data relating to patients with melanoma. We obtained tumour samples to assess BRAF mutational status, and available tissues underwent exploratory genotyping analysis. Disease response was measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and adverse events were defined by common toxicity criteria. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00687622. FINDINGS: 97 patients with melanoma were enrolled, including 81 with cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma (36 BRAF mutant, 39 BRAF wild-type, six BRAF status unknown), and 16 with uveal melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash or dermatitis acneiform (n=80; 82%) and diarrhoea (44; 45%), most of which were grade 2 or lower. No cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas were recorded. Of 36 patients with BRAF mutations, 30 had not received a BRAF inhibitor before; two complete responses (both confirmed) and ten partial responses (eight confirmed) were noted in this subgroup (confirmed response rate, 33%). Median progression-free survival of this subgroup was 5·7 months (95% CI 4·0-7·4). Of the six patients who had received previous BRAF inhibition, one unconfirmed partial response was recorded. Of 39 patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma, four partial responses were confirmed (confirmed response rate, 10%). INTERPRETATION: Our data show substantial clinical activity of trametinib in melanoma and suggest that MEK is a valid therapeutic target. Differences in response rates according to mutations indicate the importance of mutational analyses in the future. FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.	B	high	This is a multicenter, phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial involving 97 patients with advanced melanoma. It provides primary patient data with statistical results (response rates, progression-free survival), which aligns with the definition of Level B evidence.
6f6470be-9310-5c61-86fb-7134d53acc7d	C	Mismatch repair deficiency associated with complete remission to combination programmed cell death ligand immune therapy in a patient with sporadic urothelial carcinoma: immunotheranostic considerations.	BACKGROUND: Mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD) is a common pathway of malignant transformation accounting for approximately 15-20 % of human carcinogensis. It has been postulated that MMRD increases tumor antigenicity and highlights a role for immunotherapeutic approach MMR-deficient cancers. This strategy was pursued in a patient with upper tract urothelial carcinoma, and the results are reported here. CASE PRESENTATION: Molecular profiling was performed using next generation DNA sequencing and (IHC) testing for MMR and PD-L1. A patient with sporadic, high grade urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis was found to have a hypermutator genotype with 73 mutations occurring amidst 62 known drivers of malignancy, and 340 VUS alterations. MMR deficiency phenotype was confirmed by the absence of MSH2 and MSH6 as well as deleterious mutations in these genes. IHC staining for programmed cell death ligand-1 [PD-L1] revealed 2+ staining in 80 % of cells. The patient gained access to combination immunotherapy trial utilizing MEDI4736 and MEDI0680 through a clinical trial. The patient achieved a prolonged, complete remission within two months and had no severe ill effects from the treatment. CONCLUSION: Given their ability to generate neo-antigens, MMR-deficient cancers may be uniquely susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitor strategies, including urothelial tract cancers. Screening for MMR deficient cancers has the potential to become a routine strategy for evaluating the role of PD-L1 inhibitors for patient with advanced disease. ( TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00938834. Registered 13 July 2009).

92f2fb79-2bae-5727-85e1-c68cde934705	D	Kinase mutations and imatinib response in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor.	PURPOSE: Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) express constitutively activated mutant isoforms of KIT or kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) that are potential therapeutic targets for imatinib mesylate. The relationship between mutations in these kinases and clinical response to imatinib was examined in a group of patients with advanced GIST. PATIENTS AND METHODS: GISTs from 127 patients enrolled onto a phase II clinical study of imatinib were examined for mutations of KIT or PDGFRA. Mutation types were correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: Activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA were found in 112 (88.2%) and six (4.7%) GISTs, respectively. Most KIT mutations involved exon 9 (n = 23) or exon 11 (n = 85). All KIT mutant isoforms, but only a subset of PDGFRA mutant isoforms, were sensitive to imatinib, in vitro. In patients with GISTs harboring exon 11 KIT mutations, the partial response rate (PR) was 83.5%, whereas patients with tumors containing an exon 9 KIT mutation or no detectable mutation of KIT or PDGFRA had PR rates of 47.8% (P =.0006) and 0.0% (P <.0001), respectively. Patients whose tumors contained exon 11 KIT mutations had a longer event-free and overall survival than those whose tumors expressed either exon 9 KIT mutations or had no detectable kinase mutation. CONCLUSION: Activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA are found in the vast majority of GISTs, and the mutational status of these oncoproteins is predictive of clinical response to imatinib. PDGFRA mutations can explain response and sensitivity to imatinib in some GISTs lacking KIT mutations.	B	high	The study is a Phase II clinical trial involving 127 patients, which constitutes primary patient data with a significant sample size (>5 patients). It also presents statistical results (P-values) correlating kinase mutations with clinical response to imatinib, fitting the criteria for Level B evidence.
7341b6fa-1852-5b9e-b8ec-04979c3166da	B	Regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer.	Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks the activity of protein kinases involved in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis (VEGFR1, 2, 3; angiopoietin-1 receptor), oncogenesis (stem cell growth factor receptor; RET; BRAF including BRAFV600E), and tumor microenvironment (PDGFR-β and FGFR). Based on data from the Phase III CORRECT study, regorafenib stands as a further option for patient affected by metastatic colorectal cancer who have exhausted previous available therapies. Its multi-targeted effect might explain activity in advanced lines of treatment, when cancer cells have been heavily challenged with previous lines of therapy and potentially developed multiple mechanisms of resistance, but also makes difficult to identify predictive biomarkers. In this article we examine preclinical as well as clinical data of regorafenib in the therapy of metastatic colorectal cancer, challenges for potential markers of efficacy and its role in the treatment algorithm.	A	high	The abstract explicitly states that the article examines clinical data, including findings from a 'Phase III CORRECT study'. Phase III clinical trials are considered Level A evidence, representing validated associations and often leading to practice-changing evidence, as suggested by the statement that regorafenib 'stands as a further option' for patients.
5d0bb35c-a311-5e64-a639-252b4ca626b5	D	Activating HER2 mutations in HER2 gene amplification negative breast cancer.	UNLABELLED: Data from 8 breast cancer genome-sequencing projects identified 25 patients with HER2 somatic mutations in cancers lacking HER2 gene amplification. To determine the phenotype of these mutations, we functionally characterized 13 HER2 mutations using in vitro kinase assays, protein structure analysis, cell culture, and xenograft experiments. Seven of these mutations are activating mutations, including G309A, D769H, D769Y, V777L, P780ins, V842I, and R896C. HER2 in-frame deletion 755-759, which is homologous to EGF receptor (EGFR) exon 19 in-frame deletions, had a neomorphic phenotype with increased phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3. L755S produced lapatinib resistance, but was not an activating mutation in our experimental systems. All of these mutations were sensitive to the irreversible kinase inhibitor, neratinib. These findings show that HER2 somatic mutation is an alternative mechanism to activate HER2 in breast cancer and they validate HER2 somatic mutations as drug targets for breast cancer treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: We show that the majority of HER2 somatic mutations in breast cancer patients are activating mutations that likely drive tumorigenesis. Several patients had mutations that are resistant to the reversible HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, but are sensitive to the irreversible HER2 inhibitor, neratinib. Our results suggest that patients with HER2 mutation–positive breast cancers could benefit from existing HER2-targeted drugs.	D	high	The study primarily relies on in vitro kinase assays, cell culture experiments, and xenograft models to functionally characterize HER2 mutations and test their sensitivity to drugs. While mutations were initially identified from patient genome-sequencing projects, the core evidence for the activating nature of these mutations and their drug response is derived from preclinical models, not direct human clinical trials or observations of patient outcomes.
e2f57d30-abed-5093-899e-2cb25e7f9d87	D	The ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor PF-06463922 Overcomes Primary Resistance to Crizotinib in ALK-Driven Neuroblastoma.	UNLABELLED: Neuroblastomas harboring activating point mutations in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are differentially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, with certain mutations conferring intrinsic crizotinib resistance. To overcome this clinical obstacle, our goal was to identify inhibitors with improved potency that can target intractable ALK variants such as F1174L. We find that PF-06463922 has high potency across ALK variants and inhibits ALK more effectively than crizotinib in vitro. Most importantly, PF-06463922 induces complete tumor regression in both crizotinib-resistant and crizotinib-sensitive xenograft mouse models of neuroblastoma, as well as in patient-derived xenografts harboring the crizotinib-resistant F1174L or F1245C mutations. These studies demonstrate that PF-06463922 has the potential to overcome crizotinib resistance and exerts unprecedented activity as a single targeted agent against F1174L and F1245C ALK-mutated xenograft tumors, while also inducing responses in an R1275Q xenograft model. Taken together, these results provide the rationale to move PF-06463922 into clinical trials for treatment of patients with ALK-mutated neuroblastoma. SIGNIFICANCE: The next-generation ALK/ROS1 inhibitor PF-06463922 exerts unparalleled activity in ALK-driven neuroblastoma models with primary crizotinib resistance. Our biochemical and in vivo data provide the preclinical rationale for fast-tracking the development of this agent in children with relapsed/refractory ALK-mutant neuroblastoma.	D	high	The study describes in vitro experiments and in vivo results from xenograft mouse models, including patient-derived xenografts. The abstract explicitly states 'Our biochemical and in vivo data provide the preclinical rationale,' which aligns directly with the definition of Level D (Preclinical Evidence: In vivo or in vitro models; Not direct human evidence).
cb014e76-4d62-5843-b829-83f584fbbbe0	D	Synergistic effect of SU11248 with cytarabine or daunorubicin on FLT3 ITD-positive leukemic cells.	Fetal liver tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3 ITD) mutations are the most common molecular abnormality associated with adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To exploit this molecular target, a number of potent and specific FLT3 kinase inhibitors have been developed and are currently being tested in early phase clinical trials of patients with refractory AML. To explore the efficacy of combining a FLT3 inhibitor with standard AML chemotherapy drugs, we tested the effect of combining the FLT3 inhibitor SU11248 with cytarabine or daunorubicin on the proliferation and survival of cell lines expressing either mutant (FLT3 ITD or FLT3 D835V) or wild-type (WT) FLT3. SU11248 had additive-to-synergistic inhibitory effects on FLT3-dependent leukemic cell proliferation when combined with cytarabine or daunorubicin. The synergistic interaction of SU11248 and the traditional antileukemic agents was more pronounced for induction of apoptosis. SU11248 inhibited the proliferation of primary AML myeloblasts expressing mutant FLT3 ITD but not WT FLT3 protein. Combining SU11248 and cytarabine synergistically inhibited the proliferation of primary AML myeloblasts expressing FLT3 ITD but not WT FLT3 protein. These data suggest that the addition of potent FLT3 inhibitors such as SU11248 to AML chemotherapy regimens could result in improved treatment results.	D	high	The study describes experiments conducted on cell lines (in vitro models) and primary AML myeloblasts, which are also used in an in vitro context. This constitutes preclinical evidence, as it is not direct human evidence from clinical trials or patient observations.
1de8dfa8-fe1e-5568-85c0-a0fdb14bab85	D	Relapse-specific mutations in NT5C2 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) carries a poor prognosis, despite intensive retreatment, owing to intrinsic drug resistance. The biological pathways that mediate resistance are unknown. Here, we report the transcriptome profiles of matched diagnosis and relapse bone marrow specimens from ten individuals with pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia using RNA sequencing. Transcriptome sequencing identified 20 newly acquired, novel nonsynonymous mutations not present at initial diagnosis, with 2 individuals harboring relapse-specific mutations in the same gene, NT5C2, encoding a 5'-nucleotidase. Full-exon sequencing of NT5C2 was completed in 61 further relapse specimens, identifying additional mutations in 5 cases. Enzymatic analysis of mutant proteins showed that base substitutions conferred increased enzymatic activity and resistance to treatment with nucleoside analog therapies. Clinically, all individuals who harbored NT5C2 mutations relapsed early, within 36 months of initial diagnosis (P = 0.03). These results suggest that mutations in NT5C2 are associated with the outgrowth of drug-resistant clones in ALL.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from more than 5 individuals (10 initial samples, then 61 further relapse specimens) and presents statistical results (P = 0.03) correlating NT5C2 mutations with early relapse. While it includes some preclinical enzymatic analysis, the core findings and association are derived from human patient data, fitting the criteria for Clinical Evidence.
b39e11de-69dd-5bf4-a169-55f283e50369	D	NTRK1 fusions for the therapeutic intervention of Korean patients with colon cancer.	The identification and clinical validation of cancer driver genes are essential to accelerate the translational transition of cancer genomics, as well as to find clinically confident targets for the therapeutic intervention of cancers. Here we identified recurrent LMNA-NTRK1 and TPM3-NTRK1 fusions in Korean patients with colon cancer (3 out of 147, 2%) through next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NTRK1 fusions were mutually exclusive oncogenic drivers of colon cancer that were accompanied with in vitro potential of colony formation and in vivo tumorigenicity comparable to KM12, a human colon cancer cell line harboring TPM3-NTRK1 fusion. NTRK1-encoded TrkA protein was prevalent in 11 out of 216 Korean (5.1%) and 28 out of 472 Chinese patients (5.9%) from independent cohorts, respectively. The expression level of TrkA was significantly correlated with NTRK1 fusion (p = 0.0192), which was verified by a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Korean patients with TrkA-positive colon cancer had a marginal but significant shorter overall survival time than TrkA-negative colon cancer [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.5346, 95% confidential interval (CI) = 0.2548-0.9722, p = 0.0411]. In addition, KM12 cell line was sensitive to selective TrkA inhibitors. These results demonstrate that NTRK1 fusion is granted as a clinically relevant target for therapeutic intervention of colon cancer.	B	high	The study involves the analysis of NTRK1 fusions and TrkA protein expression in large cohorts of Korean and Chinese colon cancer patients (e.g., 147, 216, and 472 patients). It provides statistical results, including hazard ratios and p-values for overall survival, which constitutes primary patient data with more than 5 patients and statistical analysis, fitting the criteria for Level B. While it also includes preclinical (in vitro/in vivo) evidence, the substantial clinical patient data and statistical findings are the primary drivers for this classification.
62cecf12-53c4-5612-8841-3e96066f996a	D	Activity of dasatinib against L576P KIT mutant melanoma: molecular, cellular, and clinical correlates.	Point mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase gene have recently been identified in mucosal, acral lentiginous, and chronically sun-damaged melanomas. We have identified the first human melanoma cell line with an endogenous L576P mutation, the most common KIT mutation in melanoma ( approximately 30-40%). In vitro testing showed that the cell viability of the L576P mutant cell line was not reduced by imatinib, nilotinib, or sorafenib small molecule KIT inhibitors effective in nonmelanoma cells with other KIT mutations. However, the viability of the mutant cells was reduced by dasatinib at concentrations as low as 10 nM (P = 0.004). Molecular modeling studies found that the L576P mutation induces structural changes in KIT that reduce the affinity for imatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = -2.52 kcal/mol) but not for dasatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = +0.32 kcal/mol). Two metastatic melanoma patients with the L576P KIT mutation were treated with dasatinib, including one patient previously treated with imatinib. Both patients had marked reduction (>50%) and elimination of tumor F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging after dasatinib treatment. These data support the selective inhibitory effect of dasatinib against cells harboring the most common KIT mutation in melanoma, and thus has therapeutic implications for acrallentiginous, chronic sun-damaged, and mucosal melanomas.	C	high	The study includes preclinical evidence (in vitro cell line experiments and molecular modeling) but also presents clinical observations from two metastatic melanoma patients treated with dasatinib, showing marked reduction in tumor activity. This constitutes a very small patient series (<5 patients), which aligns with the definition of Level C.
3f49b91f-edc0-58d9-9063-f27483f7da63	C	Dasatinib in imatinib-resistant Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias.	BACKGROUND: The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is effective in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) leukemias, but relapse occurs, mainly as a result of the outgrowth of leukemic subclones with imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations. We evaluated dasatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor that targets most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Patients with various phases of CML or with Ph-positive ALL who could not tolerate or were resistant to imatinib were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation study. Dasatinib (15 to 240 mg per day) was administered orally in four-week treatment cycles, once or twice daily. RESULTS: A complete hematologic response was achieved in 37 of 40 patients with chronic-phase CML, and major hematologic responses were seen in 31 of 44 patients with accelerated-phase CML, CML with blast crisis, or Ph-positive ALL. In these two phases, the rates of major cytogenetic response were 45 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Responses were maintained in 95 percent of patients with chronic-phase disease and in 82 percent of patients with accelerated-phase disease, with a median follow-up more than 12 months and 5 months, respectively. Nearly all patients with lymphoid blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL had a relapse within six months. Responses occurred among all BCR-ABL genotypes, with the exception of the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to both dasatinib and imatinib in vitro. Myelosuppression was common but not dose-limiting. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib induces hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with CML or Ph-positive ALL who cannot tolerate or are resistant to imatinib.

The fluoropyrimidines are the mainstay chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of many types of cancers. Detoxifying metabolism of fluoropyrimidines requires dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, encoded by the DPYD gene), and reduced or absent activity of this enzyme can result in severe, and sometimes fatal, toxicity. We summarize evidence from the published literature supporting this association and provide dosing recommendations for fluoropyrimidines based on DPYD genotype (updates at http://www.pharmgkb.org).	A	high	The publication is explicitly titled 'Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines' and the abstract states 'provide dosing recommendations for fluoropyrimidines based on DPYD genotype'. This aligns directly with Level A, which includes 'practice guidelines' as an example of proven/consensus association in human medicine.
20744627-d206-5ab8-a417-c763750dfbef	D	Axitinib effectively inhibits BCR-ABL1(T315I) with a distinct binding conformation.	The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is a driver oncogene in chronic myeloid leukaemia and 30-50% of cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Introduction of ABL1 kinase inhibitors (for example, imatinib) has markedly improved patient survival, but acquired drug resistance remains a challenge. Point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain weaken inhibitor binding and represent the most common clinical resistance mechanism. The BCR-ABL1 kinase domain gatekeeper mutation Thr315Ile (T315I) confers resistance to all approved ABL1 inhibitors except ponatinib, which has toxicity limitations. Here we combine comprehensive drug sensitivity and resistance profiling of patient cells ex vivo with structural analysis to establish the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a selective and effective inhibitor for T315I-mutant BCR-ABL1-driven leukaemia. Axitinib potently inhibited BCR-ABL1(T315I), at both biochemical and cellular levels, by binding to the active form of ABL1(T315I) in a mutation-selective binding mode. These findings suggest that the T315I mutation shifts the conformational equilibrium of the kinase in favour of an active (DFG-in) A-loop conformation, which has more optimal binding interactions with axitinib. Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unexpected opportunity to repurpose axitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug approved for renal cancer, as an inhibitor for ABL1 gatekeeper mutant drug-resistant leukaemia patients. This study shows that wild-type proteins do not always sample the conformations available to disease-relevant mutant proteins and that comprehensive drug testing of patient-derived cells can identify unpredictable, clinically significant drug-repositioning opportunities.	C	high	The abstract describes 'Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow.' This constitutes a single-patient case study, which falls under Level C. While there is also preclinical (ex vivo/in vitro) evidence, the direct human evidence is limited to this one patient.
2873fc62-404c-5b23-aafd-0227cef76640	C	Segmental basal cell naevus syndrome caused by an activating mutation in smoothened.	Aberrant sonic hedgehog signalling, mostly due to PTCH1 mutations, has been shown to play a central role in the pathogenesis of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), as well as in basal cell naevus syndrome (BCNS). Mutations in smoothened (SMO) encoding a receptor for sonic hedgehog have been reported in sporadic BCCs but not in BCNS. We report a case with multiple BCCs, pits and comedones in a segmental distribution over the upper part of the body, along with other findings compatible with BCNS. Histopathologically, there were different types of BCC. A heterozygous mutation (c.1234C>T, p.L412F) in SMO was detected in three BCCs but not in peripheral blood lymphocytes or the uninvolved skin. These were compatible with the type 1 mosaic form of BCNS. The p.L412F mutation was found experimentally to result in increased SMO transactivating activity, and the patient responded to vismodegib therapy. Activating mutations in SMO may cause BCNS. The identification of a gain-of-function mutation in SMO causing a type 1 mosaic form of BCNS further expands our understanding of the pathogenesis of BCC, with implications for the treatment of these tumours, whether sporadic or inherited.

cc8be07f-c9cf-57ef-9a10-15575edddd76	D	Comparative analysis of two clinically active BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors reveals the role of conformation-specific binding in resistance.	Structural studies suggest that most point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain cause resistance to the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib by impairing the flexibility of the kinase domain, restricting its ability to adopt the inactive conformation required for optimal imatinib binding, rather than by directly interfering with drug contact residues. BMS-354825, currently in clinical development for imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia, is a dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor that binds ABL in both the active and inactive conformation. To examine the potential role of conformational binding properties in drug resistance, we mapped the mutations in BCR-ABL capable of conferring resistance to BMS-354825. Through saturation mutagenesis, we identified 10 such BCR-ABL mutations, 8 of which occurred at drug contact residues. Some mutants were unique to BMS-354825, whereas others also conferred imatinib resistance. Remarkably, the identity of the amino acid substitution at either of two contact residues differentially affects sensitivity to imatinib or BMS-354825. The combination of imatinib plus BMS-354825 greatly reduced the recovery of drug-resistant clones. Our findings provide further rationale for considering kinase conformation in the design of kinase inhibitors against cancer targets.	D	high	The abstract describes a study that uses 'saturation mutagenesis' to identify BCR-ABL mutations and their effect on drug resistance. The findings discuss 'recovery of drug-resistant clones' and provide 'rationale for considering kinase conformation in the design of kinase inhibitors.' This methodology, focusing on molecular mechanisms and drug resistance in a laboratory setting without involving human patients or in vivo models, clearly indicates preclinical evidence, likely from in vitro models (e.g., cell lines).
2a83ba12-8e19-5dca-87e5-1d89fabdb170	D	Comparison of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and INNO-406 in imatinib-resistant cell lines.	We compared the growth-inhibitory effects and inhibition profile of the SRC family kinases (SFKs) of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and INNO-406. Dasatinib exhibited the strongest potency against BCR-ABL with little selectivity over SFKs. Nilotinib exhibited a weaker affinity than the other inhibitors, but was highly specific for ABL and may be useful for the treatment of P-glycoprotein overexpressing leukemic cells. INNO-406 had an intermediate affinity for BCR-ABL between that of dasatinib and nilotinib, and inhibited only SFKs LCK and LYN among SFKs. Both nilotinib and INNO-406 were potent inhibitors of the dasatinib-resistant T315A, F317L and F317V BCR-ABL mutations.	D	high	The study explicitly states that it uses 'imatinib-resistant cell lines' to compare the effects of different inhibitors. This indicates an in vitro, preclinical study, which falls under Level D.
b4bcbb69-f819-51b4-8592-9d59f81a4ba0	B	Selumetinib in paediatric patients with BRAF-aberrant or neurofibromatosis type 1-associated recurrent, refractory, or progressive low-grade glioma: a multicentre, phase 2 trial.	BACKGROUND: Paediatric low-grade glioma is the most common CNS tumour of childhood. Although overall survival is good, disease often recurs. No single universally accepted treatment exists for these patients; however, standard cytotoxic chemotherapies are generally used. We aimed to assess the activity of selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 study in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA. Patients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater than 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric low-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology, tumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the results of strata 1 and 3. Stratum 1 comprised patients with WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytoma harbouring either one of the two most common BRAF aberrations (KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> [Val600Glu] mutation). Stratum 3 comprised patients with any neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated paediatric low-grade glioma (WHO grades I and II). Selumetinib was provided as capsules given orally at the recommended phase 2 dose of 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily in 28-day courses for up to 26 courses. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a stratum-specific objective response (partial response or complete response), as assessed by the local site and sustained for at least 8 weeks. All responses were reviewed centrally. All eligible patients who initiated treatment were evaluable for the activity and toxicity analyses. Although the trial is ongoing in other strata, enrolment and planned follow-up is complete for strata 1 and 3. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01089101. FINDINGS: Between July 25, 2013, and June 12, 2015, 25 eligible and evaluable patients were accrued to stratum 1, and between Aug 28, 2013, and June 25, 2015, 25 eligible and evaluable patients were accrued to stratum 3. In stratum 1, nine (36% [95% CI 18-57]) of 25 patients achieved a sustained partial response. The median follow-up for the 11 patients who had not had a progression event by Aug 9, 2018, was 36·40 months (IQR 21·72-45·59). In stratum 3, ten (40% [21-61]) of 25 patients achieved a sustained partial response; median follow-up was 48·60 months (IQR 39·14-51·31) for the 17 patients without a progression event by Aug 9, 2018. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were elevated creatine phosphokinase (five [10%]) and maculopapular rash (five [10%]). No treatment-realted deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: Selumetinib is active in recurrent, refractory, or progressive pilocytic astrocytoma harbouring common BRAF aberrations and NF1-associated paediatric low-grade glioma. These results show that selumetinib could be an alternative to standard chemotherapy for these subgroups of patients, and have directly led to the development of two Children's Oncology Group phase 3 studies comparing standard chemotherapy to selumetinib in patients with newly diagnosed paediatric low-grade glioma both with and without NF1.

3d710e1e-0a45-52e4-b98d-24ef2748ef7e	B	WEE1 kinase polymorphism as a predictive biomarker for efficacy of platinum-gemcitabine doublet chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.	DNA-damaging agents are commonly used for first-line chemotherapy of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As a G2/M checkpoint kinase, Wee1 can phosphorylate CDC2-tyr15 and induce G2/M cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. The correlation of WEE1 polymorphisms to the efficacy of chemotherapy was tested in 663 advanced NSCLC patients. WEE1 rs3910384 genotype correlated to overall survival (OS) and progress-free survival (PFS) of NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Sub-group analysis revealed that rs3910384 was particularly associated with the efficacy of doublet chemotherapy combining two DNA-damaging agents, i.e. platinum and gemcitabine. NSCLC patients with the WEE1 rs3910384 G/G homozygote genotype showed 13.5 months extended OS, 3.2 months extended PFS, and a 274% relative increase in their 3-year survival rate (from 7.4% to 27.7%) compared to the A/A+A/G genotype after treatment with platinum-gemcitabine regimen. This finding was reproduced in the validation cohort. We utilized a luciferase reporter assay and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that rs3910384-linked WEE1 promoter haplotype can mediate allele-specific transcriptional binding and WEE1 expression in DNA damage response. In conclusion, the WEE1 rs3910384 G/G homozygote genotype can be used as a selective biomarker for NSCLC patients to indicate treatment with platinum and gemcitabine regimen.	B	high	The study involves a large cohort of 663 advanced NSCLC patients and a validation cohort, directly correlating a genetic polymorphism (WEE1 rs3910384) with clinical outcomes such as overall survival (OS) and progress-free survival (PFS) in response to platinum-gemcitabine chemotherapy. This constitutes primary patient data with statistical results, fitting the definition of Level B clinical evidence. While robust, it is not explicitly stated as a Phase III clinical trial or a consensus guideline, which would typically qualify for Level A.
0dc2834a-7ff1-589b-b5dc-c239c5dc108f	D	Effective molecular targeting of CDK4/6 and IGF-1R in a rare FUS-ERG fusion CDKN2A-deletion doxorubicin-resistant Ewing's sarcoma patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) nude-mouse model.	Ewing's sarcoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy. In the present study, tumor from a patient with a Ewing's sarcoma with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) loss and FUS-ERG fusion was implanted in the right chest wall of nude mice to establish a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model. The aim of the present study was to determine efficacy of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitors on the Ewing's sarcoma PDOX. The PDOX models were randomized into the following groups when tumor volume reached 50 mm3: G1, untreated control; G2, doxorubicin (DOX) (intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, weekly, for 2 weeks); G3, CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib, PD0332991, per oral (p.o.), daily, for 14 days); G4, IGF-1R inhibitor (linsitinib, OSI-906, p.o., daily, for 14 days). Tumor growth was significantly suppressed both in G3 (palbociclib) and in G4 (linsitinib) compared to G1 (untreated control) at all measured time points. In contrast, DOX did not inhibit tumor growth at any time point, which is consistent with the failure of DOX to control tumor growth in the patient. The results of the present study demonstrate the power of the PDOX model to identify effective targeted molecular therapy of a recalcitrant DOX-resistant Ewing's sarcoma with specific genetic alterations. The results of this study suggest the potential of PDOX models for individually-tailored, effective targeted therapy for recalcitrant cancer.	D	high	The study uses a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) nude-mouse model, which is an in vivo preclinical model. This falls under 'Preclinical Evidence' as it is not direct human evidence.
53d38643-a062-5c41-8c1b-2f8a677f80b8	D	Effect of MRE11 loss on PARP-inhibitor sensitivity in endometrial cancer in vitro.	AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the frequency of MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN)-complex loss of protein expression in endometrial cancers (EC) and to determine whether loss of MRE11 renders the cancer cells sensitive to Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-inhibitory treatment. METHODS: MRN expression was examined in 521 samples of endometrial carcinomas and in 10 cancer cell lines. A putative mutation hotspot in the form of an intronic poly(T) allele in MRE11 was sequenced in selected cases (n = 26). Sensitivity to the PARP-inhibitor, BMN673 was tested in colony formation assays before and after MRE11 silencing using siRNA. Homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair was evaluated by RAD51-foci formation assay upon irradiation and drug treatment. RESULTS: Loss of MRE11 protein was found in 30.7% of EC tumours and significantly associated with loss of RAD50, NBS1 and mismatch repair protein expression. One endometrial cell line showed a markedly reduced MRE11 expression due to a homozygous poly(T) mutation of MRE11, thereby exhibiting an increased sensitivity to BMN673. MRE11 depletion sensitizes MRE11 expressing EC cell lines to the treatment with BMN673. The increased sensitivity to PARP-inhibition correlates with reduced RAD51 foci formation upon ionizing radiation in MRE11-depleted cells. CONCLUSION: Loss of the MRE11 protein predicts sensitivity to PARP-inhibitor sensitivity in vitro, defining it as an additional synthetic lethal gene with PARP. The high incidence of MRE11 loss in ECs can be potentially exploited for PARP-inhibitor therapy. Furthermore, MRE11 protein expression using immunohistochemistry could be investigated as a predictive biomarker for PARP-inhibitor treatment.	D	high	The study primarily investigates the effect of MRE11 loss on PARP-inhibitor sensitivity using in vitro models (cancer cell lines, siRNA silencing, colony formation assays). While it includes an analysis of MRE11 expression in 521 human endometrial carcinoma samples, the core findings regarding drug sensitivity are derived from preclinical, cell-based experiments, as explicitly stated in the title and conclusion ('in vitro').
23214176-f517-5eee-82ca-0b770f091e8e	D	Amplification of the MET receptor drives resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in colorectal cancer.	EGF receptor (EGFR)-targeted monoclonal antibodies are effective in a subset of metastatic colorectal cancers. Inevitably, all patients develop resistance, which occurs through emergence of KRAS mutations in approximately 50% of the cases. We show that amplification of the MET proto-oncogene is associated with acquired resistance in tumors that do not develop KRAS mutations during anti-EGFR therapy. Amplification of the MET locus was present in circulating tumor DNA before relapse was clinically evident. Functional studies show that MET activation confers resistance to anti-EGFR therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, in patient-derived colorectal cancer xenografts, MET amplification correlated with resistance to EGFR blockade, which could be overcome by MET kinase inhibitors. These results highlight the role of MET in mediating primary and secondary resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in colorectal cancer and encourage the use of MET inhibitors in patients displaying resistance as a result of MET amplification.	B	high	The abstract describes findings from primary patient data, including the association of MET amplification with acquired resistance in human tumors and its presence in circulating tumor DNA. While it also includes preclinical evidence (in vitro, in vivo, and patient-derived xenografts), the direct observation in human patients elevates it beyond purely preclinical work or a simple case study. The language implies a cohort of patients rather than just a few, fitting the 'primary patient data with >5 patients' criterion for Level B.
1a0a8f22-0808-5cf8-89d8-647b1bd7709c	B	Effects of KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab plus chemotherapy in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective consortium analysis.	BACKGROUND: Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. METHODS: 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. FINDINGS: 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. INTERPRETATION: While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.

6bdfa58e-6b16-5eb4-85bc-097ec6494a46	B	UGT1A and TYMS genetic variants predict toxicity and response of colorectal cancer patients treated with first-line irinotecan and fluorouracil combination therapy.	BACKGROUND: The impact of thymidylate synthase (TYMS) and UDP-glucoronosyltransferase 1A (UGT1A) germline polymorphisms on the outcome of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients treated with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil (irinotecan/5FU) is still controversial. Our objective was to define a genetic-based algorithm to select patients to be treated with irinotecan/5FU. METHODS: Genotyping of TYMS (5'TRP and 3'UTR), UGT1A1(*)28, UGT1A9(*)22 and UGT1A7(*)3 was performed in 149 metastatic CRC patients treated with irinotecan/5FU as first-line chemotherapy enrolled in a randomised phase 3 study. Their association with response, toxicity and survival was investigated by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: TYMS 3TRP/3TRP genotype was the only independent predictor of tumour response (OR=5.87, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.68-20.45; P=0.005). UGT1A1(*)28/(*)28 was predictive for haematologic toxicity (OR=6.27, 95% CI=1.09-36.12; P=0.04), specifically for neutropenia alone (OR=6.40, 95% CI=1.11-37.03; P=0.038) or together with diarrhoea (OR=18.87, 95% CI=2.14-166.67; P=0.008). UGT1A9(*)1/(*)1 was associated with non-haematologic toxicity (OR=2.70, 95% CI=1.07-6.82; P=0.035). Haplotype VII (all non-favourable alleles) was associated with non-haematologic toxicity (OR=2.11, 95% CI=1.12-3.98; P=0.02). CONCLUSION: TYMS and UGT1A polymorphisms influence on tumour response and toxicities derived from irinotecan/5FU treatment in CRC patients. A genetic-based algorithm to optimise treatment individualisation is proposed.	B	high	The study involves genotyping in 149 metastatic colorectal cancer patients who were enrolled in a randomized phase 3 study. This constitutes primary patient data from a clinical trial with a significant number of patients (>5) and includes statistical results. While the data source is a Phase III trial, the study itself is an analysis of genetic variants and proposes an algorithm, rather than being the definitive Phase III trial that establishes a 'proven/consensus association' or 'practice-changing evidence' for the proposed algorithm. Therefore, it fits the description of Level B as 'less definitive than Level A' but still strong clinical evidence.
20744627-d206-5ab8-a417-c763750dfbef	D	Axitinib effectively inhibits BCR-ABL1(T315I) with a distinct binding conformation.	The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is a driver oncogene in chronic myeloid leukaemia and 30-50% of cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Introduction of ABL1 kinase inhibitors (for example, imatinib) has markedly improved patient survival, but acquired drug resistance remains a challenge. Point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain weaken inhibitor binding and represent the most common clinical resistance mechanism. The BCR-ABL1 kinase domain gatekeeper mutation Thr315Ile (T315I) confers resistance to all approved ABL1 inhibitors except ponatinib, which has toxicity limitations. Here we combine comprehensive drug sensitivity and resistance profiling of patient cells ex vivo with structural analysis to establish the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a selective and effective inhibitor for T315I-mutant BCR-ABL1-driven leukaemia. Axitinib potently inhibited BCR-ABL1(T315I), at both biochemical and cellular levels, by binding to the active form of ABL1(T315I) in a mutation-selective binding mode. These findings suggest that the T315I mutation shifts the conformational equilibrium of the kinase in favour of an active (DFG-in) A-loop conformation, which has more optimal binding interactions with axitinib. Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unexpected opportunity to repurpose axitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug approved for renal cancer, as an inhibitor for ABL1 gatekeeper mutant drug-resistant leukaemia patients. This study shows that wild-type proteins do not always sample the conformations available to disease-relevant mutant proteins and that comprehensive drug testing of patient-derived cells can identify unpredictable, clinically significant drug-repositioning opportunities.

83aaf169-d839-56c4-ab2a-c3a2b5607083	B	PTEN deficiency is associated with reduced sensitivity to mTOR inhibitor in human bladder cancer through the unhampered feedback loop driving PI3K/Akt activation.	BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have shown that PTEN loss enhances sensitivity to mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors because of facilitated PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase)/Akt activation and consecutive stimulation of the mTOR pathway. In patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) treated with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, PTEN loss was, however, associated with resistance to treatment. METHODS: Transitional cell carcinoma specimens, human bladder cancer cells and derived mouse xenografts were used to evaluate how the PTEN status influences the activity of mTOR inhibitors. RESULTS: Transitional cell carcinoma patients with a shorter progression-free survival under everolimus exhibited PTEN deficiency and increased Akt activation. Moreover, PTEN-deficient bladder cancer cells were less sensitive to rapamycin than cells expressing wild-type PTEN, and rapamycin strikingly induced Akt activation in the absence of functional PTEN. Inhibition of Akt activation by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin interrupted this rapamycin-induced feedback loop, thereby enhancing the antiproliferative effects of the mTOR inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: Facilitation of Akt activation upon PTEN loss can have a more prominent role in driving the feedback loop in response to mTOR inhibition than in promoting the mTOR pathway. These data support the use of both PI3K and mTOR inhibitors to treat urothelial carcinoma, in particular in the absence of functional PTEN.	B	high	The study includes primary patient data, correlating PTEN deficiency and Akt activation in transitional cell carcinoma specimens with shorter progression-free survival in patients treated with everolimus. While it also includes preclinical (in vitro and in vivo mouse xenograft) evidence, the direct human clinical observation and correlation with a clinical outcome (progression-free survival) elevates it beyond purely preclinical evidence. It is not a large-scale clinical trial (Level A) nor a very small case series (Level C), fitting the description of 'primary patient data' with clinical relevance.
20744627-d206-5ab8-a417-c763750dfbef	D	Axitinib effectively inhibits BCR-ABL1(T315I) with a distinct binding conformation.	The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is a driver oncogene in chronic myeloid leukaemia and 30-50% of cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Introduction of ABL1 kinase inhibitors (for example, imatinib) has markedly improved patient survival, but acquired drug resistance remains a challenge. Point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain weaken inhibitor binding and represent the most common clinical resistance mechanism. The BCR-ABL1 kinase domain gatekeeper mutation Thr315Ile (T315I) confers resistance to all approved ABL1 inhibitors except ponatinib, which has toxicity limitations. Here we combine comprehensive drug sensitivity and resistance profiling of patient cells ex vivo with structural analysis to establish the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a selective and effective inhibitor for T315I-mutant BCR-ABL1-driven leukaemia. Axitinib potently inhibited BCR-ABL1(T315I), at both biochemical and cellular levels, by binding to the active form of ABL1(T315I) in a mutation-selective binding mode. These findings suggest that the T315I mutation shifts the conformational equilibrium of the kinase in favour of an active (DFG-in) A-loop conformation, which has more optimal binding interactions with axitinib. Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unexpected opportunity to repurpose axitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug approved for renal cancer, as an inhibitor for ABL1 gatekeeper mutant drug-resistant leukaemia patients. This study shows that wild-type proteins do not always sample the conformations available to disease-relevant mutant proteins and that comprehensive drug testing of patient-derived cells can identify unpredictable, clinically significant drug-repositioning opportunities.	C	high	The abstract describes preclinical evidence (ex vivo profiling, biochemical and cellular inhibition) but also includes direct human evidence from a single patient: 'Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow.' This constitutes a case report, which falls under Level C.
6c459afc-d4b1-5743-acc4-58581f78b4fa	C	KDR Mutation as a Novel Predictive Biomarker of Exceptional Response to Regorafenib in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.	This is the case of an 84-year-old woman diagnosed with Stage IVb colon adenocarcinoma (CRC) metastatic to the liver, retroperitoneum, anastomotic site, and distal rectal sigmoid colon. She experienced intolerable side effects to systemic chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and bevacizumab, as well as disease progression. Next generation sequencing of her tumor was ordered, and further discussion of her malignancy's genomic information took place at a multidisciplinary molecular tumor board. The patient had mutations in KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) which made her ineligible for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors; however, a KDR p.R961W c.2881C>T mutation was noted as a variant of unknown significance (VUS). KDR (kinase insert domain receptor) is the human gene encoding for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). She was then considered a suitable candidate for regorafenib, which she could only tolerate at a low dose of 40 mg daily, with the intent of prolonging her survival and to optimize her quality of life. We report her excellent tolerance and exceptional response to low dose regorafenib, including symptomatic, tumor marker, and sustained partial metabolic radiological improvement. In the largest Phase III trial of regorafenib in CRC, only five patients (1%) of 760 experienced a partial response (versus one patient, 0.4%, receiving placebo). KDR R961W mutation has been described but no functional data has been reported. This mutation occurs in the tyrosine kinase domain of the VEGFR-2. Regorafenib targets VEGFR-2 (KDR). Hereby we hypothesize KDR mutation as a novel predictive biomarker to exceptional response to regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of the potential correlation between KDR mutation and regorafenib use for the successful management of a patient with advanced CRC, leading to what is considered an exceptional response. Further studies based on this preliminary data are warranted.

584e5c94-3c09-597a-8655-5b3e54d2fb3c	C	Targetable kinase-activating lesions in Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	BACKGROUND: Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is characterized by a gene-expression profile similar to that of BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, alterations of lymphoid transcription factor genes, and a poor outcome. The frequency and spectrum of genetic alterations in Ph-like ALL and its responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibition are undefined, especially in adolescents and adults. METHODS: We performed genomic profiling of 1725 patients with precursor B-cell ALL and detailed genomic analysis of 154 patients with Ph-like ALL. We examined the functional effects of fusion proteins and the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in mouse pre-B cells and xenografts of human Ph-like ALL. RESULTS: Ph-like ALL increased in frequency from 10% among children with standard-risk ALL to 27% among young adults with ALL and was associated with a poor outcome. Kinase-activating alterations were identified in 91% of patients with Ph-like ALL; rearrangements involving ABL1, ABL2, CRLF2, CSF1R, EPOR, JAK2, NTRK3, PDGFRB, PTK2B, TSLP, or TYK2 and sequence mutations involving FLT3, IL7R, or SH2B3 were most common. Expression of ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, JAK2, and PDGFRB fusions resulted in cytokine-independent proliferation and activation of phosphorylated STAT5. Cell lines and human leukemic cells expressing ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, and PDGFRB fusions were sensitive in vitro to dasatinib, EPOR and JAK2 rearrangements were sensitive to ruxolitinib, and the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion was sensitive to crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Ph-like ALL was found to be characterized by a range of genomic alterations that activate a limited number of signaling pathways, all of which may be amenable to inhibition with approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Trials identifying Ph-like ALL are needed to assess whether adding tyrosine kinase inhibitors to current therapy will improve the survival of patients with this type of leukemia. (Funded by the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities and others.).	B	high	The study performed genomic profiling on 1725 patients and detailed genomic analysis on 154 patients with Ph-like ALL, identifying kinase-activating alterations. This constitutes primary patient data with a large number of patients (>5), which aligns with the definition of Level B. While the study also included preclinical evidence (mouse models, cell lines), the substantial human patient cohort for genomic analysis is the primary driver for this classification.
1a8dd4c0-8dda-52bc-99a4-1d1f700d53a0	A	Improved survival with vemurafenib in melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation.	BACKGROUND: Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) have shown response rates of more than 50% in patients with metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing vemurafenib with dacarbazine in 675 patients with previously untreated, metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) or dacarbazine (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area intravenously every 3 weeks). Coprimary end points were rates of overall and progression-free survival. Secondary end points included the response rate, response duration, and safety. A final analysis was planned after 196 deaths and an interim analysis after 98 deaths. RESULTS: At 6 months, overall survival was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78 to 89) in the vemurafenib group and 64% (95% CI, 56 to 73) in the dacarbazine group. In the interim analysis for overall survival and final analysis for progression-free survival, vemurafenib was associated with a relative reduction of 63% in the risk of death and of 74% in the risk of either death or disease progression, as compared with dacarbazine (P<0.001 for both comparisons). After review of the interim analysis by an independent data and safety monitoring board, crossover from dacarbazine to vemurafenib was recommended. Response rates were 48% for vemurafenib and 5% for dacarbazine. Common adverse events associated with vemurafenib were arthralgia, rash, fatigue, alopecia, keratoacanthoma or squamous-cell carcinoma, photosensitivity, nausea, and diarrhea; 38% of patients required dose modification because of toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Vemurafenib produced improved rates of overall and progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. (Funded by Hoffmann-La Roche; BRIM-3 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01006980.).	A	high	The study describes a Phase 3 randomized clinical trial with a large patient cohort (675 patients) demonstrating statistically significant improvements in overall and progression-free survival.

01e7b47a-77ad-5f73-a6f5-5c3902dba3b7	B	Combined Epiregulin and Amphiregulin Expression Levels as a Predictive Biomarker for Panitumumab Therapy Benefit or Lack of Benefit in Patients With RAS Wild-Type Advanced Colorectal Cancer.	"IMPORTANCE: RAS wild-type (wt) status is necessary but not sufficient for response to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents in advanced colorectal cancer (aCRC). RNA expression of EGFR ligands epiregulin (EREG) and amphiregulin (AREG) may correlate with EGFR-targeted therapy efficacy in aCRC, so may represent a much-needed additional predictive marker for these drugs. OBJECTIVE: To examine a novel ligand model in a randomized clinical trial of panitumumab, irinotecan, and ciclosporin in colorectal cancer (PICCOLO) with with the a priori hypothesis that high tumor expression of either AREG or EREG would predict panitumumab therapy benefit in RAS-wt patients; and low expression, lack of efficacy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospectively planned retrospective biomarker study from the PICCOLO trial, which tested the addition of panitumumab to irinotecan therapy in patients with KRAS wt aCRC who experienced failure with prior fluoropyrimidine treatment. The analysis was conducted between 2012 and 2014. A predefined dichotomous model classified tumors as ""high expressor"" (either EREG or AREG in top tertile for messenger RNA level) or ""low expressor"" (neither EREG nor AREG in top tertile). Ligand expression was assessed as a prognostic and predictive biomarker. Expression of AREG/EREG and RAS and BRAF mutations were assessed in archival tumor tissue. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points were response rate and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the 696 PICCOLO trial patients in the irinotecan-vs-irinotecan with panitumumab randomization, 331 had sufficient tumor tissue available and measurement of ligand expression was successful in 323. High ligand expression was not prognostic for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.58-1.09]; P = .15) or PFS (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.68-1.27]; P = .64). The primary population had RAS wt aCRC (n = 220); for RAS wt patients with high ligand expression, median (interquartile range [IQR]) PFS was 8.3 [4.0-11.0] months (irinotecan with panitumumab) vs 4.4 [2.8-6.7] months (irinotecan alone); HR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.24-0.61]; P < .001). In RAS wt patients with low ligand expression, median (IQR) PFS was 3.2 [2.7-8.1] months (irinotecan with panitumumab) vs 4.0 [2.7-7.5] months (irinotecan); HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.64-1.37]; P = .73; interaction test results were significant [P = .01]). Less marked effects were seen for response rate (interaction P = .17) and OS (interaction P = .11). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: High ligand expression is a predictive marker for panitumumab therapy benefit on PFS in RAS wt patients; conversely, patients with low ligand expression gained no benefit. The current ""opt-in"" strategy for anti-EGFR therapy in all patients with RAS wt aCRC should be questioned. Expression of EREG/AREG is a useful biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy; optimization for clinical use is indicated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: isrctn Identifier: ISRCTN93248876."	B	high	This is a prospectively planned retrospective biomarker study derived from a randomized clinical trial (PICCOLO trial). It involves a large number of human patients (n=323, with 220 in the primary RAS wt population) and provides robust statistical results (hazard ratios, confidence intervals, p-values) for clinical endpoints like progression-free survival and overall survival. This constitutes strong clinical evidence, but it is a secondary analysis from an existing trial rather than a new Phase III trial specifically designed to validate the biomarker as its primary endpoint, which would typically be required for Level A.
fec95c0c-3abf-5ef9-8e67-57666c8db999	C	Dasatinib treatment of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia: analysis of responses according to preexisting BCR-ABL mutations.	Dasatinib is a BCR-ABL inhibitor with 325-fold higher potency than imatinib against unmutated BCR-ABL in vitro. Imatinib failure is commonly caused by BCR-ABL mutations. Here, dasatinib efficacy was analyzed in patients recruited to phase 2/3 trials with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia with or without BCR-ABL mutations after prior imatinib. Among 1043 patients, 39% had a preexisting BCR-ABL mutation, including 48% of 805 patients with imatinib resistance or suboptimal response. Sixty-threedifferent BCR-ABL mutations affecting 49 amino acids were detected at baseline, with G250, M351, M244, and F359 most frequently affected. After 2 years of follow-up, dasatinib treatment of imatinib-resistant patients with or without a mutation resulted in notable response rates (complete cytogenetic response: 43% vs 47%) and durable progression-free survival (70% vs 80%). High response rates were achieved with different mutations except T315I, including highly imatinib-resistant mutations in the P-loop region. Impaired responses were observed with some mutations with a dasatinib median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) greater than 3nM; among patients with mutations with lower or unknown IC(50), efficacy was comparable with those with no mutation. Overall, dasatinib has durable efficacy in patients with or without BCR-ABL mutations. All trials were registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00123474, NCT00101660, and NCT00103844.	B	high	The abstract describes an analysis of dasatinib efficacy in 1043 patients recruited to phase 2/3 clinical trials. This involves a large cohort of human patients and presents statistical results (response rates, progression-free survival), which directly aligns with the definition of Level B for 'Clinical trials (Phase I–III) or primary patient data with >5 patients. Has statistical results but less definitive than Level A.'
7b11e62b-006c-59f8-be56-b8eb9814bdd0	C	Two novel ALK mutations mediate acquired resistance to the next-generation ALK inhibitor alectinib.	PURPOSE: The first-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib is a standard therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several next-generation ALK-TKIs have entered the clinic and have shown promising activity in crizotinib-resistant patients. As patients still relapse even on these next-generation ALK-TKIs, we examined mechanisms of resistance to the next-generation ALK-TKI alectinib and potential strategies to overcome this resistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We established a cell line model of alectinib resistance, and analyzed a resistant tumor specimen from a patient who had relapsed on alectinib. We developed Ba/F3 models harboring alectinib-resistant ALK mutations and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic simulation with MP-CAFEE. RESULTS: We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs.	C	high	The study includes analysis of a tumor specimen and treatment response from a single patient who developed resistance to alectinib. This constitutes a case study, which falls under Level C. While the study also incorporates preclinical (cell line models) and inferential (computational simulation) evidence, the direct clinical observation from a single patient is the highest level of human evidence presented.
0aadfd61-ddfd-5b96-a702-eea3c13c2a08	C	Integrated genomic characterization reveals novel, therapeutically relevant drug targets in FGFR and EGFR pathways in sporadic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.	Advanced cholangiocarcinoma continues to harbor a difficult prognosis and therapeutic options have been limited. During the course of a clinical trial of whole genomic sequencing seeking druggable targets, we examined six patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Integrated genome-wide and whole transcriptome sequence analyses were performed on tumors from six patients with advanced, sporadic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (SIC) to identify potential therapeutically actionable events. Among the somatic events captured in our analysis, we uncovered two novel therapeutically relevant genomic contexts that when acted upon, resulted in preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity. Genome-wide structural analysis of sequence data revealed recurrent translocation events involving the FGFR2 locus in three of six assessed patients. These observations and supporting evidence triggered the use of FGFR inhibitors in these patients. In one example, preliminary anti-tumor activity of pazopanib (in vitro FGFR2 IC50≈350 nM) was noted in a patient with an FGFR2-TACC3 fusion. After progression on pazopanib, the same patient also had stable disease on ponatinib, a pan-FGFR inhibitor (in vitro, FGFR2 IC50≈8 nM). In an independent non-FGFR2 translocation patient, exome and transcriptome analysis revealed an allele specific somatic nonsense mutation (E384X) in ERRFI1, a direct negative regulator of EGFR activation. Rapid and robust disease regression was noted in this ERRFI1 inactivated tumor when treated with erlotinib, an EGFR kinase inhibitor. FGFR2 fusions and ERRFI mutations may represent novel targets in sporadic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and trials should be characterized in larger cohorts of patients with these aberrations.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from 6 patients, which is greater than 5. It describes clinical interventions (use of FGFR inhibitors and erlotinib) and observed anti-tumor activity and disease regression in these patients, fitting the criteria for 'Clinical Evidence' from primary patient data.
422ae56f-bc4a-507d-91ba-e1aadbb0e1df	D	FGFR<sup>3S249C</sup> mutation promotes chemoresistance by activating Akt signaling in bladder cancer cells.	Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) is a high frequency mutant gene in bladder cancer (BCa) and has become a promising therapeutic target due to its involvement in cell proliferation and migration. However, whether and how FGFR3 mutations affects BCa cell chemosensitivity is unknown. The current study aimed to elucidate the role of the FGFR3<sup>S249C</sup> mutation in the development of chemoresistance in BCa cells. The results revealed that 97-7 (FGFR3<sup>S249C</sup>) cells had decreased sensitivity to cisplatin compared with 5637 (FGFR3<sup>WT</sup>) and T24 (FGFR3<sup>WT</sup>) cells. The ratio of phosphorylated-Akt/total-Akt was higher in 97-7 (FGFR3<sup>S249C</sup>) cells, which was reversed by knockdown of FGFR3. Furthermore, inhibition of Akt signaling by GDC0068 or LY294002 increased the cisplatin sensitivity of 97-7 (FGFR3<sup>S249C</sup>) cells. GDC0068 or LY294002 was also revealed to augment the effects of cisplatin on 97-7 (FGFR3<sup>S249C</sup>) cell proliferation and apoptosis. The results of the present study demonstrated that the FGFR3<sup>S249C</sup> mutation promotes chemoresistance in BCa cells by activating the Akt signaling pathway. The FGFR3<sup>S249C</sup> mutation may therefore be used as a predictor of chemosensitivity in patients with BCa.	D	high	The study exclusively uses in vitro models, specifically bladder cancer cell lines (97-7, 5637, T24), to investigate the mechanism of chemoresistance. This aligns with the definition of Preclinical Evidence.
18c43e0f-3599-51d6-86f0-329cf25a5150	B	Relationship between p53 status and response to chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer: a meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the relationship between p53 status and response to chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer. We therefore performed a meta-analysis to expound the relationship between p53 status and response to chemotherapy. METHODS/FINDINGS: Thirteen previously published eligible studies, including 564 cases, were identified and included in this meta-analysis. p53 positive status (high expression of p53 protein and/or a mutant p53 gene) was associated with improved response in gastric cancer patients who received chemotherapy (good response: risk ratio [RR] = 0.704; 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 0.550-0.903; P = 0.006). In further stratified analyses, association with a good response remained in the East Asian population (RR = 0.657; 95% CI = 0.488-0.884; P = 0.005), while in the European subgroup, patients with p53 positive status tended to have a good response to chemotherapy, although this did not reach statistical significance (RR = 0.828, 95% CI = 0.525-1.305; P = 0.417). As five studies used neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) and one used neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT), we also analyzed these data, and found that p53 positive status was associated with a good response in gastric cancer patients who received chemotherapy-based neoadjuvant treatment (RR = 0.675, 95% CI = 0.463-0.985; P = 0.042). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicated that p53 status may be a useful predictive biomarker for response to chemotherapy in gastric cancer. Further prospective studies with larger sample sizes and better study designs are required to confirm our findings.	B	high	This is a meta-analysis of 13 previously published clinical studies involving 564 human patients. It synthesizes clinical evidence and provides statistical results, but the conclusion indicates that further prospective studies are required to confirm the findings, suggesting it has not yet reached the 'proven/consensus' or 'practice-changing' threshold of Level A.
1429a0ad-e2e1-5453-b6a2-c532c880a0f0	B	Impact of baseline BCR-ABL mutations on response to nilotinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase.	PURPOSE: Nilotinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP; CML-CP) and accelerated phase (AP; CML-AP) who are resistant to or intolerant of prior imatinib therapy. In this subanalysis of a phase II study of nilotinib in patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML-CP, the occurrence and impact of baseline and newly detectable BCR-ABL mutations were assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Baseline mutation data were assessed in 281 (88%) of 321 patients with CML-CP in the phase II nilotinib registration trial. RESULTS: Among imatinib-resistant patients, the frequency of mutations at baseline was 55%. After 12 months of therapy, major cytogenetic response (MCyR) was achieved in 60%, complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in 40%, and major molecular response (MMR) in 29% of patients without baseline mutations versus 49% (P = .145), 32% (P = .285), and 22% (P = .366), respectively, of patients with mutations. Responses in patients who harbored mutations with high in vitro sensitivity to nilotinib (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] <or= 150 nM) or mutations with unknown nilotinib sensitivity were equivalent to those responses for patients without mutations (not significant). Patients with mutations that were less sensitive to nilotinib in vitro (IC(50) > 150 nM; Y253H, E255V/K, F359V/C) had less favorable responses, as 13%, 43%, and 9% of patients with each of these mutations, respectively, achieved MCyR; none achieved CCyR. CONCLUSION: For most patients with imatinib resistance and with mutations, nilotinib offers a substantial probability of response. However, mutational status at baseline may influence response. Less sensitive mutations that occurred at three residues defined in this study, as well as the T315I mutation, may be associated with less favorable responses to nilotinib.	B	high	This is a subanalysis of a Phase II clinical trial involving 281 patients, which falls under the definition of 'Clinical trials (Phase I–III) or primary patient data with >5 patients' and includes statistical results.
8dfce319-9f42-5f3f-8f6e-7ba209537bb4	B	Atezolizumab versus docetaxel for patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (POPLAR): a multicentre, open-label, phase 2 randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Outcomes are poor for patients with previously treated, advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab is clinically active against cancer, including NSCLC, especially cancers expressing PD-L1 on tumour cells, tumour-infiltrating immune cells, or both. We assessed efficacy and safety of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC, analysed by PD-L1 expression levels on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells and in the intention-to-treat population. METHODS: In this open-label, phase 2 randomised controlled trial, patients with NSCLC who progressed on post-platinum chemotherapy were recruited in 61 academic medical centres and community oncology practices across 13 countries in Europe and North America. Key inclusion criteria were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and adequate haematological and end-organ function. Patients were stratified by PD-L1 tumour-infiltrating immune cell status, histology, and previous lines of therapy, and randomly assigned (1:1) by permuted block randomisation (with a block size of four) using an interactive voice or web system to receive intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks. Baseline PD-L1 expression was scored by immunohistochemistry in tumour cells (as percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells TC3≥50%, TC2≥5% and <50%, TC1≥1% and <5%, and TC0<1%) and tumour-infiltrating immune cells (as percentage of tumour area: IC3≥10%, IC2≥5% and <10%, IC1≥1% and <5%, and IC0<1%). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1 subgroups at 173 deaths. Biomarkers were assessed in an exploratory analysis. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01903993. FINDINGS: Patients were enrolled between Aug 5, 2013, and March 31, 2014. 144 patients were randomly allocated to the atezolizumab group, and 143 to the docetaxel group. 142 patients received at least one dose of atezolizumab and 135 received docetaxel. Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 12·6 months (95% CI 9·7-16·4) for atezolizumab versus 9·7 months (8·6-12·0) for docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0·73 [95% CI 0·53-0·99]; p=0·04). Increasing improvement in overall survival was associated with increasing PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3 HR 0·49 [0·22-1·07; p=0·068], TC2/3 or IC2/3 HR 0·54 [0·33-0·89; p=0·014], TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 HR 0·59 [0·40-0·85; p=0·005], TC0 and IC0 HR 1·04 [0·62-1·75; p=0·871]). In our exploratory analysis, patients with pre-existing immunity, defined by high T-effector-interferon-γ-associated gene expression, had improved overall survival with atezolizumab. 11 (8%) patients in the atezolizumab group discontinued because of adverse events versus 30 (22%) patients in the docetaxel group. 16 (11%) patients in the atezolizumab group versus 52 (39%) patients in the docetaxel group had treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events, and one (<1%) patient in the atezolizumab group versus three (2%) patients in the docetaxel group died from a treatment-related adverse event. INTERPRETATION: Atezolizumab significantly improved survival compared with docetaxel in patients with previously treated NSCLC. Improvement correlated with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, suggesting that PD-L1 expression is predictive for atezolizumab benefit. Atezolizumab was well tolerated, with a safety profile distinct from chemotherapy. FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech Inc.

20744627-d206-5ab8-a417-c763750dfbef	D	Axitinib effectively inhibits BCR-ABL1(T315I) with a distinct binding conformation.	The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is a driver oncogene in chronic myeloid leukaemia and 30-50% of cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Introduction of ABL1 kinase inhibitors (for example, imatinib) has markedly improved patient survival, but acquired drug resistance remains a challenge. Point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain weaken inhibitor binding and represent the most common clinical resistance mechanism. The BCR-ABL1 kinase domain gatekeeper mutation Thr315Ile (T315I) confers resistance to all approved ABL1 inhibitors except ponatinib, which has toxicity limitations. Here we combine comprehensive drug sensitivity and resistance profiling of patient cells ex vivo with structural analysis to establish the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a selective and effective inhibitor for T315I-mutant BCR-ABL1-driven leukaemia. Axitinib potently inhibited BCR-ABL1(T315I), at both biochemical and cellular levels, by binding to the active form of ABL1(T315I) in a mutation-selective binding mode. These findings suggest that the T315I mutation shifts the conformational equilibrium of the kinase in favour of an active (DFG-in) A-loop conformation, which has more optimal binding interactions with axitinib. Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unexpected opportunity to repurpose axitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug approved for renal cancer, as an inhibitor for ABL1 gatekeeper mutant drug-resistant leukaemia patients. This study shows that wild-type proteins do not always sample the conformations available to disease-relevant mutant proteins and that comprehensive drug testing of patient-derived cells can identify unpredictable, clinically significant drug-repositioning opportunities.

ade76093-98af-5721-839f-823fe09b8a6a	D	Emergence of polyclonal FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations during sequential therapy with sorafenib and sunitinib in FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical activity of sequential therapy with sorafenib and sunitinib in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD)-positive acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and monitor the emergence of secondary FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations during treatment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Six children with relapsed/refractory AML were treated with sorafenib in combination with clofarabine and cytarabine, followed by single-agent sorafenib if not a candidate for transplantation. Sunitinib was initiated after sorafenib relapse. Bone marrow samples were obtained for assessment of FLT3 TKD mutations by deep amplicon sequencing. The phase of secondary mutations with ITD alleles was assessed by cloning and sequencing of FLT3 exons 14 through 20. Identified mutations were modeled in Ba/F3 cells, and the effect of kinase inhibitors on FLT3 signaling and cell viability was assessed. RESULTS: Four patients achieved complete remission, but 3 receiving maintenance therapy with sorafenib relapsed after 14 to 37 weeks. Sunitinib reduced circulating blasts in two patients and marrow blasts in one. Two patients did not respond to sorafenib combination therapy or sunitinib. FLT3 mutations at residues D835 and F691 were observed in sorafenib resistance samples on both ITD-positive and -negative alleles. Deep sequencing revealed low-level mutations and their evolution during sorafenib treatment. Sunitinib suppressed leukemic clones with D835H and F691L mutations, but not D835Y. Cells expressing sorafenib-resistant FLT3 mutations were sensitive to sunitinib in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib has activity in patients that are resistant to sorafenib and harbor secondary FLT3 TKD mutations. The use of sensitive methods to monitor FLT3 mutations during therapy may allow individualized treatment with the currently available kinase inhibitors.

ace6a140-cd2c-56b1-bd3d-e068db31fa62	C	Detection of BCR-ABL mutations in patients with CML treated with imatinib is virtually always accompanied by clinical resistance, and mutations in the ATP phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) are associated with a poor prognosis.	Imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with acquired resistance commonly have detectable BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. It is unclear whether patients who remain sensitive to imatinib also have a significant incidence of mutations. We evaluated 144 patients treated with imatinib for BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing of 40 accelerated phase (AP), 64 late chronic phase (> or = 12 months from diagnosis, late-CP), and 40 early-CP patients. Mutations were detected in 27 patients at 17 different residues, 13 (33%) of 40 in AP, 14 (22%) of 64 in late-CP, and 0 of 40 in early-CP. Acquired resistance was evident in 24 (89%) of 27 patients with mutations. Twelve (92%) of 13 patients with mutations in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding loop (P-loop) died (median survival of 4.5 months after the mutation was detected). In contrast, only 3 (21%) of 14 patients with mutations outside the P-loop died (median follow-up of 11 months). As the detection of mutations was strongly associated with imatinib resistance, we analyzed features that predicted for their detection. Patients who commenced imatinib more than 4 years from diagnosis had a significantly higher incidence of mutations (18 [41%] of 44) compared with those treated within 4 years (9 [9%] of 100), P <.0001. Lack of a major cytogenetic response (MCR) was also associated with a higher likelihood of detecting a mutation; 19 (38%) of 50 patients without a MCR had mutations compared with 8 (8.5%) of 94 with an MCR, P <.0001. In conclusion, the detection of kinase domain mutations using a direct sequencing technique was almost always associated with imatinib resistance, and patients with mutations in the P-loop had a particularly poor prognosis.	B	high	This study involves primary patient data from a cohort of 144 human patients, which is significantly more than 5.

PURPOSE: We examined the prognostic and predictive value of serum human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) extracellular domain (sHER2) in patients with advanced breast cancer treated with lapatinib using data from three randomized trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed sHER2 and tissue HER2 (tHER2) data from 1,902 patients (84%) who were randomly assigned to receive lapatinib or control in the trials EGF30001, EGF30008, and EGF100151. Cox regression analyses were performed to correlate both biomarkers with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Median sHER2 levels were 25.1 and 10.1 ng/mL in tHER2-amplified (tHER-positive) and nonamplified (tHER-negative) populations, respectively (r = 0.42 for sHER2-tHER2 correlation). Lapatinib had significant PFS benefit over control (hazard ratio [HR], 0.855; P = .004), but not OS (HR, 0.941; P = .33). Lapatinib PFS benefit is independently predicted by higher sHER2 values (HR per 10-ng/mL increase in sHER2: lapatinib-containing therapies, 1.009 v nonlapatinib-containing therapies, 1.044; P(interaction) < .001) and by positive tHER2 (HR [lapatinib v nonlapatinib]: tHER2 positive, 0.638 v tHER2 negative, 0.940; P(interaction) = .001). Within the tHER2-positive subpopulation (n = 515), higher sHER2 values still independently predicted lapatinib PFS benefit (HR per 10-ng/mL increase in sHER2: lapatinib-containing therapies, 1.017 v nonlapatinib-containing therapies, 1.041; P(interaction) = .008). In control arms (n = 936), higher sHER2 was associated with worse prognosis in multivariable analyses (PFS HR per 10 ng/mL: PFS, 1.024; P < .001; and OS, 1.018; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Higher sHER2 predicts greater PFS benefit with lapatinib independent of tHER2 status. High sHER2 is also independently prognostic for worse survival in patients who received nonlapatinib-containing therapies. The predictive role of sHER2 for other anti-HER2 agents requires further research.	A	high	This publication is a re-analysis of data from three randomized clinical trials (EGF30001, EGF30008, and EGF100151) involving 1,902 patients. The use of data from multiple randomized controlled trials, which are typically Phase III, provides a high level of clinical evidence for establishing a predictive biomarker. The large sample size and robust statistical analysis contribute to a strong, potentially practice-changing finding regarding the predictive value of sHER2 for lapatinib efficacy.
77bfb6e4-1804-5299-8f2d-5549fc7b670d	C	Primary and secondary kinase genotypes correlate with the biological and clinical activity of sunitinib in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor.	PURPOSE: Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) harbor mutant KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) kinases, which are imatinib targets. Sunitinib, which targets KIT, PDGFRs, and several other kinases, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with GIST after they experience imatinib failure. We evaluated the impact of primary and secondary kinase genotype on sunitinib activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor responses were assessed radiologically in a phase I/II trial of sunitinib in 97 patients with metastatic, imatinib-resistant/intolerant GIST. KIT/PDGFRA mutational status was determined for 78 patients by using tumor specimens obtained before and after prior imatinib therapy. Kinase mutants were biochemically profiled for sunitinib and imatinib sensitivity. RESULTS: Clinical benefit (partial response or stable disease for > or = 6 months) with sunitinib was observed for the three most common primary GIST genotypes: KIT exon 9 (58%), KIT exon 11 (34%), and wild-type KIT/PDGFRA (56%). Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer for patients with primary KIT exon 9 mutations (P = .0005) or with a wild-type genotype (P = .0356) than for those with KIT exon 11 mutations. The same pattern was observed for overall survival (OS). PFS and OS were longer for patients with secondary KIT exon 13 or 14 mutations (which involve the KIT-adenosine triphosphate binding pocket) than for those with exon 17 or 18 mutations (which involve the KIT activation loop). Biochemical profiling studies confirmed the clinical results. CONCLUSION: The clinical activity of sunitinib after imatinib failure is significantly influenced by both primary and secondary mutations in the predominant pathogenic kinases, which has implications for optimization of the treatment of patients with GIST.	B	high	This publication describes a Phase I/II clinical trial involving 97 patients with metastatic, imatinib-resistant/intolerant GIST.

19b8f1da-0327-5eed-a380-56ec2767d074	D	Frequent mutation of the PI3K pathway in head and neck cancer defines predictive biomarkers.	Genomic findings underscore the heterogeneity of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Identification of mutations that predict therapeutic response would be a major advance. We determined the mutationally altered, targetable mitogenic pathways in a large HNSCC cohort. Analysis of whole-exome sequencing data from 151 tumors revealed the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway to be the most frequently mutated oncogenic pathway (30.5%). PI3K pathway-mutated HNSCC tumors harbored a significantly higher rate of mutations in known cancer genes. In a subset of human papillomavirus-positive tumors, PIK3CA or PIK3R1 was the only mutated cancer gene. Strikingly, all tumors with concurrent mutation of multiple PI3K pathway genes were advanced (stage IV), implicating concerted PI3K pathway aberrations in HNSCC progression. Patient-derived tumorgrafts with canonical and noncanonical PIK3CA mutations were sensitive to an mTOR/PI3K inhibitor (BEZ-235), in contrast to PIK3CA-wild-type tumorgrafts. These results suggest that PI3K pathway mutations may serve as predictive biomarkers for treatment selection.	B	high	The study involves whole-exome sequencing data from 151 human tumors, which constitutes primary patient data from a large cohort. This analysis identifies frequent mutations in the PI3K pathway and correlates them with clinical features like advanced disease stage. This direct analysis of a substantial number of human samples aligns with the definition of Level B (Clinical Evidence). While the study also includes preclinical experiments using patient-derived tumorgrafts to suggest predictive biomarkers, the foundation of the findings is the extensive human cohort data.
cc8be07f-c9cf-57ef-9a10-15575edddd76	D	Comparative analysis of two clinically active BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors reveals the role of conformation-specific binding in resistance.	Structural studies suggest that most point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain cause resistance to the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib by impairing the flexibility of the kinase domain, restricting its ability to adopt the inactive conformation required for optimal imatinib binding, rather than by directly interfering with drug contact residues. BMS-354825, currently in clinical development for imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia, is a dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor that binds ABL in both the active and inactive conformation. To examine the potential role of conformational binding properties in drug resistance, we mapped the mutations in BCR-ABL capable of conferring resistance to BMS-354825. Through saturation mutagenesis, we identified 10 such BCR-ABL mutations, 8 of which occurred at drug contact residues. Some mutants were unique to BMS-354825, whereas others also conferred imatinib resistance. Remarkably, the identity of the amino acid substitution at either of two contact residues differentially affects sensitivity to imatinib or BMS-354825. The combination of imatinib plus BMS-354825 greatly reduced the recovery of drug-resistant clones. Our findings provide further rationale for considering kinase conformation in the design of kinase inhibitors against cancer targets.	D	high	The abstract describes experiments using 'saturation mutagenesis' to identify mutations conferring drug resistance and observing the 'recovery of drug-resistant clones'. These methods are characteristic of in vitro or preclinical studies, not direct human clinical trials or patient data.
5a5e703b-2908-50bd-8dca-3618a4fb3ff1	C	PIK3CA mutations in colorectal cancer are associated with clinical resistance to EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies.	The monoclonal antibodies (moAb) panitumumab and cetuximab target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and have proven valuable for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). EGFR-mediated signaling involves two main intracellular cascades: on one side KRAS activates BRAF, which in turn triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinases. On the other, membrane localization of the lipid kinase PIK3CA counteracts PTEN and promotes AKT1 phosphorylation, thereby activating a parallel intracellular axis. Constitutive activation of KRAS bypasses the corresponding signaling cascade and, accordingly, patients with mCRC bearing KRAS mutations are clinically resistant to therapy with panitumumab or cetuximab. We hypothesized that mutations activating PIK3CA could also preclude responsiveness to EGFR-targeted moAbs through a similar mechanism. Here, we present the mutational analysis of PIK3CA and KRAS and evaluation of the PTEN protein status in a cohort of 110 patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR moAbs. We observed 15 (13.6%) PIK3CA and 32 (29.0%) KRAS mutations. PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with clinical resistance to panitumumab or cetuximab; none of the mutated patients achieved objective response (P = 0.038). When only KRAS wild-type tumors were analyzed, the statistical correlation was stronger (P = 0.016). Patients with PIK3CA mutations displayed a worse clinical outcome also in terms of progression-free survival (P = 0.035). Our data indicate that PIK3CA mutations can independently hamper the therapeutic response to panitumumab or cetuximab in mCRC. When the molecular status of the PIK3CA/PTEN and KRAS pathways are concomitantly ascertained, up to 70% of mCRC patients unlikely to respond to EGFR moAbs can be identified.	B	high	The study involves a cohort of 110 human patients, which is primary patient data with more than 5 patients. It presents statistical results (P-values) demonstrating a significant association between PIK3CA mutations and clinical resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies, fitting the criteria for clinical evidence that is less definitive than Level A.

INTRODUCTION: Tumor protein p53 gene (TP53) mutations are common in stage I through III non-small cell lung cancer, but clinical trials have shown inconsistent results regarding their relationship to the effects of adjuvant therapy. The objective is to clarify their putative prognostic and predictive effects. METHODS: A pooled analysis of TP53 mutations (exons 5-8) was conducted in four randomized trials (the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial, J BRonchus 10, Cancer and Leukemia Group B-9633, and Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association trial) of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) versus observation (OBS). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mutant versus wild-type (WT) TP53 for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated using a multivariable Cox model stratified on trial and adjusted on sex, age, and clinicopathological variables. Predictive value was evaluated with an interaction between treatment and TP53. RESULTS: A total of 1209 patients (median follow-up 5.5 years) were included. There were 573 deaths (47%) and 653 DFS events (54%). Mutations (434 [36%]) had no prognostic effect (OBS HROS = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.77-1.28, p = 0.95; HRDFS = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.78-1.25, p = 0.92) but were marginally predictive of benefit from ACT for OS (test for interaction: OS, p = 0.06; DFS, p = 0.11). Patients with WT TP53 had a tendency toward better outcomes with ACT than did those in the OBS group (HROS = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62-0.95, p = 0.02; HRDFS = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62-0.92, p = 0.005). In the ACT arm, a deleterious effect of mutant versus WT TP53 was observed (HROS = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.10-1.78, p = 0.006; HRDFS = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.04-1.64, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: TP53 mutation had no prognostic effect but was marginally predictive for survival from ACT. In patients who received ACT, TP53 mutation tended to be associated with shorter survival than wild-type TP53.

61ece131-1339-5ca1-b687-11b5d904e465	B	Phase II Pilot Study of Vemurafenib in Patients With Metastatic BRAF-Mutated Colorectal Cancer.	PURPOSE: BRAF V600E mutation is seen in 5% to 8% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) and is associated with poor prognosis. Vemurafenib, an oral BRAF V600 inhibitor, has pronounced activity in patients with metastatic melanoma, but its activity in patients with BRAF V600E-positive metastatic CRC was unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multi-institutional, open-label study, patients with metastatic CRC with BRAF V600 mutations were recruited to an expansion cohort at the previously determined maximum-tolerated dose of 960 mg orally twice a day. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled, of whom 20 had received at least one prior metastatic chemotherapy regimen. Grade 3 toxicities included keratoacanthomas, rash, fatigue, and arthralgia. Of the 21 patients treated, one patient had a confirmed partial response (5%; 95% CI, 1% to 24%) and seven other patients had stable disease by RECIST criteria. Median progression-free survival was 2.1 months. Patterns of concurrent mutations, microsatellite instability status, CpG island methylation status, PTEN loss, EGFR expression, and copy number alterations were not associated with clinical benefit. In contrast to prior expectations, concurrent KRAS and NRAS mutations were detected at low allele frequency in a subset of the patients' tumors (median, 0.21% allele frequency) and were apparent mechanisms of acquired resistance in vemurafenib-sensitive patient-derived xenograft models. CONCLUSION: In marked contrast to the results seen in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma, single-agent vemurafenib did not show meaningful clinical activity in patients with BRAF V600E mutant CRC. Combination strategies are now under development and may be informed by the presence of intratumor heterogeneity of KRAS and NRAS mutations.

fec95c0c-3abf-5ef9-8e67-57666c8db999	B	Dasatinib treatment of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia: analysis of responses according to preexisting BCR-ABL mutations.	Dasatinib is a BCR-ABL inhibitor with 325-fold higher potency than imatinib against unmutated BCR-ABL in vitro. Imatinib failure is commonly caused by BCR-ABL mutations. Here, dasatinib efficacy was analyzed in patients recruited to phase 2/3 trials with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia with or without BCR-ABL mutations after prior imatinib. Among 1043 patients, 39% had a preexisting BCR-ABL mutation, including 48% of 805 patients with imatinib resistance or suboptimal response. Sixty-threedifferent BCR-ABL mutations affecting 49 amino acids were detected at baseline, with G250, M351, M244, and F359 most frequently affected. After 2 years of follow-up, dasatinib treatment of imatinib-resistant patients with or without a mutation resulted in notable response rates (complete cytogenetic response: 43% vs 47%) and durable progression-free survival (70% vs 80%). High response rates were achieved with different mutations except T315I, including highly imatinib-resistant mutations in the P-loop region. Impaired responses were observed with some mutations with a dasatinib median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) greater than 3nM; among patients with mutations with lower or unknown IC(50), efficacy was comparable with those with no mutation. Overall, dasatinib has durable efficacy in patients with or without BCR-ABL mutations. All trials were registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00123474, NCT00101660, and NCT00103844.

786da755-8f66-5761-9e2a-2c5315292732	B	The influence of insulin-like Growth Factor-1-Receptor expression and endocrine treatment on clinical outcome of postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients: A Dutch TEAM substudy analysis.	BACKGROUND: Signaling via the Insulin-like Growth Factor type 1 Receptor (IGF1R) plays a crucial role in cancer development. In breast cancer (BC), IGF1R and estrogen receptor expression are correlated. In this current study we explored the hypothesis that postmenopausal hormone receptor positive (HR+ve) BC patients with high IGF1R tumor expression still have estrogen driven IGF1R stimulated tumor growth when treated with tamoxifen, resulting in detrimental clinical outcome compared to patients treated with exemestane. Additionally, we assessed the added value of metformin as this drug may lower IGF1R stimulation. METHODS: Of 2,446 Dutch TEAM patients, randomized to either exemestane for 5 years or sequential treatment (tamoxifen for 2-3 years followed by exemestane for another 3-2 years) tumor tissue microarray sections were immunohistochemically stained for IGF1R. Overall Survival (OS), Breast Cancer specific Survival (BCSS) and Relapse-Free Survival (RFS) were assessed in patient subgroups with low and high IGF1R expression, and in patients with or without metformin use. RESULTS: High IGF1R tumor expression was significantly associated with exemestane therapy for RFS (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.58-0.95, p = 0.02). In addition, the combination of metformin with exemestane resulted in improved efficacy, yielding a 5-yrs RFS of 95% (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10-1.00, p = 0.02, compared to sequential treatment). No relation was observed in tumors with low IGF-1R expression. CONCLUSION: This study suggests IGF1R as a potential biomarker of improved clinical outcome in HR+ve BC patients treated with exemestane. Adding metformin to exemestane treatment may add to this effect.

Purpose Detection of specific molecular alterations in tumors guides the selection of effective targeted treatment of patients with several types of cancer. These molecular alterations may occur in other tumor types for which the efficacy of targeted therapy remains unclear. The MyPathway study evaluates the efficacy and safety of selected targeted therapies in tumor types that harbor relevant genetic alterations but are outside of current labeling for these treatments. Methods MyPathway ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02091141) is a multicenter, nonrandomized, phase IIa multiple basket study. Patients with advanced refractory solid tumors harboring molecular alterations in human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1, or the Hedgehog pathway are treated with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, erlotinib, vemurafenib, or vismodegib, respectively. The primary end point is investigator-assessed objective response rate within each tumor-pathway cohort. Results Between April 1, 2014 and November 1, 2016, 251 patients with 35 different tumor types received study treatment. The efficacy population contains 230 treated patients who were evaluated for response or discontinued treatment before evaluation. Fifty-two patients (23%) with 14 different tumor types had objective responses (complete, n = 4; partial, n = 48). Tumor-pathway cohorts with notable objective response rates included human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-amplified/overexpressing colorectal (38% [14 of 37]; 95% CI, 23% to 55%) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 V600-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (43% [six of 14]; 95% CI, 18% to 71%). Conclusion The four currently approved targeted therapy regimens in the MyPathway study produced meaningful responses when administered without chemotherapy in several refractory solid tumor types not currently labeled for these agents.

17d7e05a-35e9-56bb-a9bf-7203471bafe9	C	Smoothened mutation confers resistance to a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor in medulloblastoma.	The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is inappropriately activated in certain human cancers, including medulloblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. GDC-0449, a drug that inhibits Hh signaling by targeting the serpentine receptor Smoothened (SMO), has produced promising anti-tumor responses in early clinical studies of cancers driven by mutations in this pathway. To evaluate the mechanism of resistance in a medulloblastoma patient who had relapsed after an initial response to GDC-0449, we determined the mutational status of Hh signaling genes in the tumor after disease progression. We identified an amino acid substitution at a conserved aspartic acid residue of SMO that had no effect on Hh signaling but disrupted the ability of GDC-0449 to bind SMO and suppress this pathway. A mutation altering the same amino acid also arose in a GDC-0449-resistant mouse model of medulloblastoma. These findings show that acquired mutations in a serpentine receptor with features of a G protein-coupled receptor can serve as a mechanism of drug resistance in human cancer.	C	high	The study describes the mechanism of drug resistance in a single medulloblastoma patient who relapsed after treatment. This constitutes a case study or a very small patient series (in this case, one patient), which aligns with Level C. While a mouse model was also used, the primary observation of resistance in a human patient is the core finding.

"EGFR mutated lung cancer accounts for a significant subgroup of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Over the last decade, multiple EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have been developed to target mutated EGFR. However, there is little information regarding mutation specific potency of EGFR-TKIs against various types of EGFR mutations. The purpose of this study is to establish an in vitro model to determine the ""therapeutic window"" of EGFR-TKIs against various types of EGFR mutations, including EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. The potency of 1st (erlotinib), 2nd (afatinib) and 3rd (osimertinib and rociletinib) generation EGFR-TKIs was compared in vitro for human lung cancer cell lines and Ba/F3 cells, which exogenously express mutated or wild type EGFR. An in vitro model of mutation specificity was created by calculating the ratio of IC50 values between mutated and wild type EGFR. The in vitro model identified a wide therapeutic window of afatinib for exon 19 deletions and L858R and of osimertinib and rociletinib for T790M positive mutations. The results obtained with our models matched well with previously reported preclinical and clinical data. Interestingly, for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, most of which are known to be resistant to 1st and 2nd generation EGFR-TKIS, osimertinib was potent and presented a wide therapeutic window. To our knowledge, this is the first report that has identified the therapeutic window of osimertinib for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. In conclusion, this model will provide a preclinical rationale for proper selection of EGFR-TKIs against clinically-relevant EGFR mutations."	D	high	The study explicitly states it establishes and uses an 'in vitro model' with 'human lung cancer cell lines and Ba/F3 cells' to determine the mutation specificity of EGFR-TKIs. This directly aligns with the definition of Preclinical Evidence (Level D), which includes in vitro models.
fec95c0c-3abf-5ef9-8e67-57666c8db999	B	Dasatinib treatment of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia: analysis of responses according to preexisting BCR-ABL mutations.	Dasatinib is a BCR-ABL inhibitor with 325-fold higher potency than imatinib against unmutated BCR-ABL in vitro. Imatinib failure is commonly caused by BCR-ABL mutations. Here, dasatinib efficacy was analyzed in patients recruited to phase 2/3 trials with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia with or without BCR-ABL mutations after prior imatinib. Among 1043 patients, 39% had a preexisting BCR-ABL mutation, including 48% of 805 patients with imatinib resistance or suboptimal response. Sixty-threedifferent BCR-ABL mutations affecting 49 amino acids were detected at baseline, with G250, M351, M244, and F359 most frequently affected. After 2 years of follow-up, dasatinib treatment of imatinib-resistant patients with or without a mutation resulted in notable response rates (complete cytogenetic response: 43% vs 47%) and durable progression-free survival (70% vs 80%). High response rates were achieved with different mutations except T315I, including highly imatinib-resistant mutations in the P-loop region. Impaired responses were observed with some mutations with a dasatinib median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) greater than 3nM; among patients with mutations with lower or unknown IC(50), efficacy was comparable with those with no mutation. Overall, dasatinib has durable efficacy in patients with or without BCR-ABL mutations. All trials were registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00123474, NCT00101660, and NCT00103844.	B	high	The abstract describes an analysis of dasatinib efficacy in 1043 patients recruited to phase 2/3 clinical trials.

Interleukins-6 (IL-6)/GP130 signaling pathway represents a promising target for cancer therapy due to its critical role in survival and progression of multiple types of cancer. We have identified Bazedoxifene, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug used for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, with novel function as inhibitor of IL-6/GP130 interaction. In this study, we investigate the effect of Bazedoxifene in rhabdomyosarcoma and evaluate whether inhibiting IL-6/GP130 signaling is an effective therapeutic strategy for rhabdomyosarcoma. The inhibitory effect of Bazedoxifene was assessed in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines in vitro and RH30 xenograft model was used to further examine the suppressive efficacy of Bazedoxifene on tumor growth in vivo. Rhabdomyosarcoma cells showed their sensitivity to GP130 inhibition using gene knockdown or neutralized antibody, suggesting IL-6/GP130 as therapeutic target in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Bazedoxifene decreased the signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, blocked STAT3 DNA binding, and down-regulated the expression of STAT3 downstream genes. Bazedoxifene also induced cell apoptosis, reduced cell viability, and inhibited colony formation in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. The inhibition of colony formation, STAT3 phosphorylation, or cell viability following Bazedoxifene treatment was partially reversed by addition of excess IL-6 or overexpression of constitutive STAT3, respectively, supporting Bazedoxifene acted through IL-6/GP130 signaling. In addition, Bazedoxifene repressed cell invasion and angiogenesis in vitro. Furthermore, oral administration of Bazedoxifene significantly suppressed tumor growth and expression of STAT3 phosphorylation in nude mice bearing established human rhabdomyosarcoma xenograft. Taken together, these findings validate IL-6/GP130 signaling as therapeutic target in rhabdomyosarcoma and provide first evidence that Bazedoxifene may serve as a novel promising drug targeting IL-6/GP130 for treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma.	D	high	The study investigates the effect of Bazedoxifene using rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines (in vitro) and a RH30 xenograft model in nude mice (in vivo).

PURPOSE: Trastuzumab shows clinical activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-positive early and advanced breast cancer. In the German Breast Group 26/Breast International Group 03-05 trial, we investigated if trastuzumab treatment should be continued beyond progression. METHODS: Patients with HER-2-positive breast cancer that progresses during treatment with trastuzumab were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine (2,500 mg/m(2) body-surface area on days 1 through 14 [1,250 mg/m(2) semi-daily]) alone or with continuation of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg body weight) in 3-week cycles. The primary end point was time to progression. RESULTS: We randomly assigned 78 patients to capecitabine and 78 patients to capecitabine plus trastuzumab. Sixty-five events and 38 deaths in the capecitabine group and 62 events and 33 deaths in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group occurred during 15.6 months of follow-up. Median times to progression were 5.6 months in the capecitabine group and 8.2 months in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.97; two-sided log-rank P = .0338). Overall survival rates were 20.4 months (95% CI, 17.8 to 24.7) in the capecitabine group and 25.5 months (95% CI, 19.0 to 30.7) in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group (P = .257). Overall response rates were 27.0% with capecitabine and 48.1% with capecitabine plus trastuzumab (odds ratio, 2.50; P = .0115). Continuation of trastuzumab beyond progression was not associated with increased toxicity. CONCLUSION: Continuation of trastuzumab plus capecitabine showed a significant improvement in overall response and time to progression compared with capecitabine alone in women with HER-2-positive breast cancer who experienced progression during trastuzumab treatment.	A	high	This publication describes a randomized controlled clinical trial (German Breast Group 26/Breast International Group 03-05 study) involving 156 patients.

20744627-d206-5ab8-a417-c763750dfbef	D	Axitinib effectively inhibits BCR-ABL1(T315I) with a distinct binding conformation.	The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is a driver oncogene in chronic myeloid leukaemia and 30-50% of cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Introduction of ABL1 kinase inhibitors (for example, imatinib) has markedly improved patient survival, but acquired drug resistance remains a challenge. Point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain weaken inhibitor binding and represent the most common clinical resistance mechanism. The BCR-ABL1 kinase domain gatekeeper mutation Thr315Ile (T315I) confers resistance to all approved ABL1 inhibitors except ponatinib, which has toxicity limitations. Here we combine comprehensive drug sensitivity and resistance profiling of patient cells ex vivo with structural analysis to establish the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a selective and effective inhibitor for T315I-mutant BCR-ABL1-driven leukaemia. Axitinib potently inhibited BCR-ABL1(T315I), at both biochemical and cellular levels, by binding to the active form of ABL1(T315I) in a mutation-selective binding mode. These findings suggest that the T315I mutation shifts the conformational equilibrium of the kinase in favour of an active (DFG-in) A-loop conformation, which has more optimal binding interactions with axitinib. Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unexpected opportunity to repurpose axitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug approved for renal cancer, as an inhibitor for ABL1 gatekeeper mutant drug-resistant leukaemia patients. This study shows that wild-type proteins do not always sample the conformations available to disease-relevant mutant proteins and that comprehensive drug testing of patient-derived cells can identify unpredictable, clinically significant drug-repositioning opportunities.	C	high	The abstract describes 'Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow.' This constitutes a single-patient case report, which falls under Level C according to the provided definitions ('Case reports or very small patient series (<5 patients). Often single-patient reports in clinical journals.'). While the study also includes preclinical evidence (ex vivo patient cells, biochemical and cellular level inhibition), the direct human evidence from a single patient is the strongest clinical component.
1fdda6c9-08f9-5c17-bdbf-23ab6b5701f4	B	Topoisomerase I but not thymidylate synthase is associated with improved outcome in patients with resected colorectal cancer treated with irinotecan containing adjuvant chemotherapy.	BACKGROUND: Thymidylate synthase (TS) and Topoisomerase I (Topo I) are significant biomarkers in colorectal cancer (CRC). We aimed to study the expression of TS and Topo I in patients with resected CRC who received adjuvant chemotherapy and correlated it with clinical outcome. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with CRC between 1989 and 2007 and treated with adjuvant chemotherapy within Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group's (HeCOG) protocols, were identified. Archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were used for immunohistochemical detection of TS and Topo I. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarray slides using monoclonal antibodies against TS and Topo I. The results were correlated with survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS). RESULTS: A cohort of 498 patients with a median age of 61 years and Dukes' stage B (49%) and C (51%) fulfilled the criteria of the study. All patients received adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy, 38% irinotecan-containing. Positive TS and Topo I expression was found in 43% and 48% of cases, respectively. Five-year OS was 74% and DFS was 68%. In univariate analysis no association of TS and Topo I expression with OS and DFS was identified. In multivariate analysis however, Topo I expression was associated with a reduced risk of death (HR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.42-0.88, p = 0.009). In the irinotecan-treated subgroup, those patients who expressed Topo I had a better OS (HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.94, p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Patients with resected CRC expressing Topo I seem to benefit from irinotecan-containing adjuvant chemotherapy. However randomised prospective trials are needed to confirm these results.	B	high	This study is a retrospective analysis of primary patient data from a cohort of 498 patients. It correlates biomarker expression with clinical outcomes (overall survival and disease-free survival) and provides statistical results (Hazard Ratios, confidence intervals, p-values).

4e9bedd3-9995-5495-a60b-1acad74159c1	C	Correlation of kinase genotype and clinical outcome in the North American Intergroup Phase III Trial of imatinib mesylate for treatment of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor: CALGB 150105 Study by Cancer and Leukemia Group B and Southwest Oncology Group.	PURPOSE: Imatinib mesylate is standard treatment for patients who have advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), but not all patients benefit equally. In previous studies, GIST genotype correlated with treatment outcome and optimal imatinib dosing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the relationship between kinase genotype and treatment outcome for 428 patients enrolled on the North American phase III study SWOG S0033/CALGB 150105 and treated with either 400 mg or 800 mg daily doses of imatinib. RESULTS: The presence of KIT exon 11-mutant genotype (n = 283) correlated with improved treatment outcome when compared with KIT exon 9-mutant (n = 32) and wild-type (WT; n = 67) genotypes for objective response (complete response [CR]/partial response [PR], 71.7% v 44.4% [P = .007]; and 44.6% [P = .0002], respectively); time to tumor progression (TTP; median 24.7 months v 16.7 and 12.8 months, respectively); and overall survival (OS; median 60.0 months v 38.4 and 49.0 months, respectively). The survival outcomes for patients with exon 9-mutant, exon 11-mutant or WT GIST were not affected by imatinib dose. However, there was evidence of improved response rates for patients with exon 9-mutant tumors treated with imatinib 800 mg versus 400 mg (CR/PR, 67% v 17%; P = .02). Patients who had CD117-negative GIST had similar TTP but inferior OS compared with patients who had CD117-positive disease, which suggests that patients who have CD117-negative GIST may benefit from imatinib treatment. In addition, we identified novel but rare mutations of the KIT extracellular domain (exons 8 and 9). CONCLUSION: We confirmed the favorable impact of KIT exon 11 genotype when compared with KIT exon 9 and wild-type genotype for patients with advanced GIST who are treated with imatinib.

9c754749-ed1e-5ce1-9fcf-0900bc4b6a2d	B	Levels of gemcitabine transport and metabolism proteins predict survival times of patients treated with gemcitabine for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients who undergo surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) frequently receive adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy. Key determinants of gemcitabine cytotoxicity include the activities of the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), and ribonucleotide reductase subunit 1 (RRM1). We investigated whether tumor levels of these proteins were associated with efficacy of gemcitabine therapy following surgery. METHODS: Sequential samples of resected PDACs were retrospectively collected from 434 patients at 5 centers; 142 patients did not receive adjuvant treatment (33%), 243 received adjuvant gemcitabine-based regimens (56%), and 49 received nongemcitabine regimens (11%). We measured protein levels of hENT1, dCK, and RRM1 by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry with tissue microarrays and investigated their relationship with patients' overall survival time. RESULTS: The median overall survival time of patients was 32.0 months. Among patients who did not receive adjuvant treatment, levels of hENT1, RRM1, and dCK were not associated with survival time. Among patients who received gemcitabine, high levels of hENT1 and dCK were significantly associated with longer survival time (hazard ratios of 0.34 [P < .0001] and 0.57 [P = .012], respectively). Interaction tests for gemcitabine administration and hENT1 and dCK status were statistically significant (P = .0007 and P = .016, respectively). On multivariate analysis of this population, hENT1 and dCK retained independent predictive values, and those patients with high levels of each protein had the longest survival times following adjuvant therapy with gemcitabine. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of hENT1 and dCK in PDAC predict longer survival times in patients treated with adjuvant gemcitabine.	B	high	This is a retrospective cohort study involving a large number of human patients (434 patients from 5 centers) and provides statistical results on the association between protein levels and overall survival time in patients treated with gemcitabine.

d48023f5-2a4e-5ee5-952c-ff749f4718cb	D	ATM mutations uniformly lead to ATM dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: application of functional test using doxorubicin.	ATM abnormalities are frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and represent an important prognostic factor. Sole 11q deletion does not result in ATM inactivation by contrast to biallelic defects involving mutations. Therefore, the analysis of ATM mutations and their functional impact is crucial. In this study, we analyzed ATM mutations in predominantly high-risk patients using: i) resequencing microarray and direct sequencing; ii) Western blot for total ATM level; iii) functional test based on p21 gene induction after parallel treatment of leukemic cells with fludarabine and doxorubicin. ATM dysfunction leads to impaired p21 induction after doxorubicin exposure. We detected ATM mutation in 16% (22 of 140) of patients, and all mutated samples manifested demonstrable ATM defect (impaired p21 upregulation after doxorubicin and/or null protein level). Loss of ATM function in mutated samples was also evidenced through defective p53 pathway activation after ionizing radiation exposure. ATM mutation frequency was 34% in patients with 11q deletion, 4% in the TP53-defected group, and 8% in wild-type patients. Our functional test, convenient for routine use, showed high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (97%) for ATM mutations prediction. Only cells with ATM mutation, but not those with sole 11q deletion, were resistant to doxorubicin. As far as fludarabine is concerned, this difference was not observed. Interestingly, patients from both these groups experienced nearly identical time to first treatment. In conclusion, ATM mutations either alone or in combination with 11q deletion uniformly led to demonstrable ATM dysfunction in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mutation presence can be predicted by the functional test using doxorubicin.	B	high	The study analyzes ATM mutations and their functional impact in a cohort of 140 human patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It presents primary patient data, including statistical results such as mutation frequency, sensitivity (80%), and specificity (97%) of a functional test.

97afae62-ad99-584e-940c-d8e7d6ba6e04	C	Heterogeneity of genetic changes associated with acquired crizotinib resistance in ALK-rearranged lung cancer.	BACKGROUND: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is markedly sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. However, acquired resistance to crizotinib is inevitable through several mechanisms. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify genetic alterations associated with crizotinib resistance. METHODS: Tumor samples were derived from seven ALK-positive NSCLC patients who showed acquired resistance to crizotinib, and these patients were analyzed for ALK, EGFR, and KRAS mutations and ALK and EGFR gene amplifications. In vitro cytotoxicity of crizotinib and ALK downstream signals were compared between crizotinib-naive and -resistant NSCLC cells. RESULTS: After a median duration of 6 months (range, 4-12 months), seven ALK-positive NSCLC patients developed acquired resistance to crizotinib. Three patients harbored secondary ALK mutations, including one patient with both mutations: L1196M (n = 2) and G1269A (n = 2). Of note, one patient displayed ALK gene copy number gain (4.1-fold increase compared with the pre-crizotinib specimen) and EGFR L858R mutation with high polysomy. The amphiregulin concentration was high in the supernatant fluid from five patients with malignant pleural effusion (116.4-18934.0 pg/ml). SNU-2535 cells derived from a patient who harbored the G1269 mutation were resistant to crizotinib treatment similar to H3122 CR1 cells. L1196M and G1269A mutant clones were less sensitive to crizotinib and ALK downstream signals were ineffectively suppressed in these clones. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic changes associated with crizotinib resistance are heterogeneous in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients who respond to crizotinib and subsequently develop resistance.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from seven ALK-positive NSCLC patients who developed acquired resistance to crizotinib. This number of patients (7) falls within the definition of Level B, which includes 'primary patient data with >5 patients'. While the study also includes in vitro experiments, the core findings are derived from the analysis of human tumor samples and patient outcomes.
ace6a140-cd2c-56b1-bd3d-e068db31fa62	C	Detection of BCR-ABL mutations in patients with CML treated with imatinib is virtually always accompanied by clinical resistance, and mutations in the ATP phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) are associated with a poor prognosis.	Imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with acquired resistance commonly have detectable BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. It is unclear whether patients who remain sensitive to imatinib also have a significant incidence of mutations. We evaluated 144 patients treated with imatinib for BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing of 40 accelerated phase (AP), 64 late chronic phase (> or = 12 months from diagnosis, late-CP), and 40 early-CP patients. Mutations were detected in 27 patients at 17 different residues, 13 (33%) of 40 in AP, 14 (22%) of 64 in late-CP, and 0 of 40 in early-CP. Acquired resistance was evident in 24 (89%) of 27 patients with mutations. Twelve (92%) of 13 patients with mutations in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding loop (P-loop) died (median survival of 4.5 months after the mutation was detected). In contrast, only 3 (21%) of 14 patients with mutations outside the P-loop died (median follow-up of 11 months). As the detection of mutations was strongly associated with imatinib resistance, we analyzed features that predicted for their detection. Patients who commenced imatinib more than 4 years from diagnosis had a significantly higher incidence of mutations (18 [41%] of 44) compared with those treated within 4 years (9 [9%] of 100), P <.0001. Lack of a major cytogenetic response (MCR) was also associated with a higher likelihood of detecting a mutation; 19 (38%) of 50 patients without a MCR had mutations compared with 8 (8.5%) of 94 with an MCR, P <.0001. In conclusion, the detection of kinase domain mutations using a direct sequencing technique was almost always associated with imatinib resistance, and patients with mutations in the P-loop had a particularly poor prognosis.	B	high	This study involves primary patient data from a cohort of 144 human patients and presents significant statistical results regarding the association between BCR-ABL mutations, imatinib resistance, and prognosis. This aligns with the definition of Level B, which includes clinical trials or primary patient data with more than 5 patients and statistical results, but is less definitive than Level A.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of JNJ-42756493 from 0.5 to 12 mg administered continuously daily or JNJ-42756493 10 or 12 mg administered intermittently (7 days on/7 days off). RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were enrolled. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included hyperphosphatemia (65%), asthenia (55%), dry mouth (45%), nail toxicity (35%), constipation (34%), decreased appetite (32%), and dysgeusia (31%). Twenty-seven patients (42%) experienced grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events, and one dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 ALT elevation was observed at 12 mg daily. Maximum-tolerated dose was not defined. Nine milligrams daily was considered as the initial RP2D; however, tolerability was improved with intermittent schedules, and 10 mg administered on a 7-days-on/7-days-off schedule was considered the final RP2D. Pharmacokinetics were linear, dose proportional, and predictable, with a half-life of 50 to 60 hours. Dose-dependent elevations in serum phosphate, a manifestation of pharmacodynamic effect, occurred in all patients starting at 4 mg daily. Among 23 response-evaluable patients with tumor FGFR pathway alterations, four confirmed responses and one unconfirmed partial response were observed in patients with glioblastoma and urothelial and endometrial cancer (all with FGFR2 or FGFR3 translocations); 16 patients had stable disease. CONCLUSION: JNJ-42756493 administered at 10 mg on a 7-days-on/7-days-off schedule achieved exposures at which clinical responses were observed, demonstrated pharmacodynamic biomarker activity, and had a manageable safety profile.

Bosutinib, a dual Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has shown potent activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This phase 1/2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily bosutinib 500 mg in leukemia patients after resistance/intolerance to imatinib. The current analysis included 118 patients with chronic-phase CML who had been pretreated with imatinib followed by dasatinib and/or nilotinib, with a median follow-up of 28.5 months. In this subpopulation, major cytogenetic response was attained by 32% of patients; complete cytogenetic response was attained by 24%, including in one of 3 patients treated with 3 prior TKIs. Complete hematologic response was achieved/maintained in 73% of patients. On-treatment transformation to accelerated/blast phase occurred in 5 patients. At 2 years, Kaplan-Meier-estimated progression-free survival was 73% and estimated overall survival was 83%. Responses were seen across Bcr-Abl mutations, including those associated with dasatinib and nilotinib resistance, except T315I. Bosutinib had an acceptable safety profile; treatment-emergent adverse events were primarily manageable grade 1/2 gastrointestinal events and rash. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic adverse events (> 2% of patients) included diarrhea (8%) and rash (4%). Bosutinib may offer a new treatment option for patients with chronic-phase CML after treatment with multiple TKIs. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00261846.	B	high	The abstract describes a Phase 1/2 clinical study involving 118 human patients with chronic-phase CML.

587bf891-0fd2-5bd4-990b-bca834bf8366	D	Oncogenic and sorafenib-sensitive ARAF mutations in lung adenocarcinoma.	"Targeted cancer therapies often induce ""outlier"" responses in molecularly defined patient subsets. One patient with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma, who was treated with oral sorafenib, demonstrated a near-complete clinical and radiographic remission for 5 years. Whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing of primary tumor and normal samples from this patient identified a somatic mutation, ARAF S214C, present in the cancer genome and expressed at high levels. Additional mutations affecting this residue of ARAF and a nearby residue in the related kinase RAF1 were demonstrated across 1% of an independent cohort of lung adenocarcinoma cases. The ARAF mutations were shown to transform immortalized human airway epithelial cells in a sorafenib-sensitive manner. These results suggest that mutant ARAF is an oncogenic driver in lung adenocarcinoma and an indicator of sorafenib response."	C	high	The abstract describes a near-complete remission in 'one patient' treated with sorafenib, which is a single-patient case report. While it mentions 'additional mutations... across 1% of an independent cohort,' this refers to the prevalence of mutations, not clinical outcomes or a trial involving more than 5 patients demonstrating a response to sorafenib. The study also includes preclinical evidence (in vitro cell line experiments), which falls under Level D. However, the primary clinical evidence for the association of ARAF mutations with sorafenib response is derived from a single patient, classifying it as a case study.
d541c69d-19ad-51ba-9152-36fb206e6436	D	Genetic alterations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway confer sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells to therapeutic targeting of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin.	We investigated the genotype-dependent therapeutic potential of targeting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway for thyroid cancer. Proliferation of TPC1, Hth7, FTC133, OCUT1, K1, and BCPAP cells that harbored PI3K/Akt-activating genetic alterations was potently inhibited by the Akt inhibitor perifosine, whereas SW1736, Hth74, WRO, KAT18, and TAD2 cells that harbored no genetic alterations had no or only modest responses. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by perifosine was seen in these cells. Genetic-dependent apoptosis was induced by perifosine in cells selectively tested. Similarly, potent inhibition of cell proliferation by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor temsirolimus occurred in virtually all the cells harboring genetic alterations, whereas modest inhibition was seen in some of the cells not harboring genetic alterations. Temsirolimus inhibited the phosphorylation of p70S6K, a substrate of mTOR. Knockdown of Akt1/2 or mTOR by shRNA approach inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of FTC133 and OCUT1 cells that harbored genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway but had no effect on SW1736 and KAT18 cells that did not. Transfection with PIK3CA mutants greatly sensitized SW1736 cells to perifosine and temsirolimus. Growth of xenograft tumors derived from FTC133 cells but not SW1736 cells in nude mice was dramatically inhibited by perifosine. Thus, this work for the first time shows that genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway confer thyroid cancer cells addiction to this pathway and their sensitivity to inhibition by targeting Akt and mTOR. This genotype-based targeting of the PI3K/Akt pathway using Akt and mTOR inhibitors may offer an effective therapeutic strategy for thyroid cancer and warrants further studies.	D	high	The study describes experiments conducted on various thyroid cancer cell lines (in vitro models) and xenograft tumors in nude mice (in vivo models).

e40b311d-b83f-5d96-b43a-7e5895f19230	D	Antitumor activity of BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in preclinical models of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.	The protein kinase BRAF is a key component of the RAS-RAF signaling pathway which plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in BRAF at codon 600 promote catalytic activity and are associated with 8% of all human (solid) tumors, including 8% to 10% of colorectal cancers (CRC). Here, we report the preclinical characterization of vemurafenib (RG7204; PLX4032; RO5185426), a first-in-class, specific small molecule inhibitor of BRAF(V600E) in BRAF-mutated CRC cell lines and tumor xenograft models. As a single agent, vemurafenib shows dose-dependent inhibition of ERK and MEK phosphorylation, thereby arresting cell proliferation in BRAF(V600)-expressing cell lines and inhibiting tumor growth in BRAF(V600E) bearing xenograft models. Because vemurafenib has shown limited single-agent clinical activity in BRAF(V600E)-mutant metastatic CRC, we therefore explored a range of combination therapies, with both standard agents and targeted inhibitors in preclinical xenograft models. In a BRAF-mutant CRC xenograft model with de novo resistance to vemurafenib (RKO), tumor growth inhibition by vemurafenib was enhanced by combining with an AKT inhibitor (MK-2206). The addition of vemurafenib to capecitabine and/or bevacizumab, cetuximab and/or irinotecan, or erlotinib resulted in increased antitumor activity and improved survival in xenograft models. Together, our findings suggest that the administration of vemurafenib in combination with standard-of-care or novel targeted therapies may lead to enhanced and sustained clinical antitumor efficacy in CRCs harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation.	D	high	The study explicitly states it is a 'preclinical characterization' and describes experiments conducted in 'BRAF-mutated CRC cell lines' and 'tumor xenograft models'.

8bf842af-7bbc-568d-bdad-fdb791c0e717	D	Activity of second-generation ALK inhibitors against crizotinib-resistant mutants in an NPM-ALK model compared to EML4-ALK.	Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in both solid and hematological tumors. About 80% of ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) cases are characterized by the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation, encoding for the aberrant fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK, whereas 5% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients carry the inv(2)(p21;p23) rearrangement, encoding for the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion. The ALK/c-MET/ROS inhibitor crizotinib successfully improved the treatment of ALK-driven diseases. However, several cases of resistance appeared in NSCLC patients, and ALK amino acid substitutions were identified as a leading cause of resistance to crizotinib. Second-generation ALK inhibitors have been developed in order to overcome crizotinib resistance. In this work, we profiled in vitro the activity of crizotinib, AP26113, ASP3026, alectinib, and ceritinib against six mutated forms of ALK associated with clinical resistance to crizotinib (C1156Y, L1196M, L1152R, G1202R, G1269A, and S1206Y) and provide a classification of mutants according to their level of sensitivity/resistance to the drugs. Since the biological activity of ALK mutations extends beyond the specific type of fusion, both NPM-ALK- and EML4-ALK-positive cellular models were used. Our data revealed that most mutants may be targeted by using different inhibitors. One relevant exception is represented by the G1202R substitution, which was highly resistant to all drugs (>10-fold increased IC50 compared to wild type) and may represent the most challenging mutation to overcome. These results provide a prediction of cross-resistance of known crizotinib-resistant mutations against all second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) clinically available, and therefore could be a useful tool to help clinicians in the management of crizotinib-resistance cases.	D	high	The study describes 'in vitro' profiling of drug activity against mutated ALK forms using 'cellular models,' which falls under preclinical evidence as it does not involve direct human patient data.
a71acf6a-4fdf-588a-ab1e-840fc7c12d90	B	Selumetinib plus docetaxel for KRAS-mutant advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study.	BACKGROUND: No targeted therapies are available for KRAS-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Selumetinib is an inhibitor of MEK1/MEK2, downstream of KRAS, with preclinical evidence of synergistic activity with docetaxel in KRAS-mutant cancers. We did a prospective, randomised, phase 2 trial to assess selumetinib plus docetaxel in previously treated patients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC. METHODS: Eligible patients were older than 18 years of age; had histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB-IV KRAS-mutant NSCLC; had failed first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC; had WHO performance status of 0-1; had not received previous therapy with either a MEK inhibitor or docetaxel; and had adequate bone marrow, renal, and liver function. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to either oral selumetinib (75 mg twice daily in a 21 day cycle) or placebo; all patients received intravenous docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 21 day cycle). Randomisation was done with an interactive voice response system and investigators, patients, data analysts, and the trial sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed for all patients with confirmed KRAS mutations. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00890825. FINDINGS: Between April 20, 2009, and June 30, 2010, we randomly assigned 44 patients to receive selumetinib and docetaxel (selumetinib group) and 43 to receive placebo and docetaxel (placebo group). Of these, one patient in the selumetinib group and three in the placebo group were excluded from efficacy analyses because their tumours were not confirmed to be KRAS-mutation positive. Median overall survival was 9·4 months (6·8-13·6) in the selumetinib group and 5·2 months (95% CI 3·8-non-calculable) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] for death 0·80, 80% CI 0·56-1·14; one-sided p=0·21). Median progression-free survival was 5·3 months (4·6-6·4) in the selumetinib group and 2·1 months (95% CI 1·4-3·7) in the placebo group (HR for progression 0·58, 80% CI 0·42-0·79; one-sided p=0·014). 16 (37%) patients in the selumetinib group and none in the placebo group had an objective response (p<0·0001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 36 (82%) patients in the selumetinib group and 28 (67%) patients in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (29 [67%] of 43 patients in the selumetinib group vs 23 [55%] of 42 patients in the placebo group), febrile neutropenia (eight [18%] of 44 patients in the selumetinib group vs none in the placebo group), dyspnoea (one [2%] of 44 patients in the selumetinib group vs five [12%] of 42 in the placebo group), and asthenia (four [9%] of 44 patients in the selumetinib group vs none in the placebo group). INTERPRETATION: Selumetinib plus docetaxel has promising efficacy, albeit with a higher number of adverse events than with docetaxel alone, in previously treated advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC. These findings warrant further clinical investigation of selumetinib plus docetaxel in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. FUNDING: AstraZeneca.

b41b9844-8097-5358-8af1-23ddf331d163	B	Targeting mutant NRAS signaling pathways in melanoma.	Cutaneous melanoma is a devastating form of skin cancer and its incidence is increasing faster than any other preventable cancer in the United States. The mutant NRAS subset of melanoma is more aggressive and associated with poorer outcomes compared to non-NRAS mutant melanoma. The aggressive nature and complex molecular signaling conferred by this transformation has evaded clinically effective treatment options. This review examines the major downstream effectors of NRAS relevant in melanoma and the associated advances made in targeted therapies that focus on these effector pathways. We outline the history of MEK inhibition in mutant NRAS melanoma and recent advances with newer MEK inhibitors. Since MEK inhibitors will likely be optimized when combined with other targeted therapies, we focus on recently identified targets that can be used in combination with MEK inhibitors.	unsure	high	The abstract explicitly states that this is a 'review' article.

Mutations in the HER2 kinase domain have been identified in human clinical lung cancer specimens. Here we demonstrate that inducible expression of the most common HER2 mutant (HER2(YVMA)) in mouse lung epithelium causes invasive adenosquamous carcinomas restricted to proximal and distal bronchioles. Continuous expression of HER2(YVMA) is essential for tumor maintenance, suggesting a key role for HER2 in lung adenosquamous tumorigenesis. Preclinical studies assessing the in vivo effect of erlotinib, trastuzumab, BIBW2992, and/or rapamycin on HER2(YVMA) transgenic mice or H1781 xenografts with documented tumor burden revealed that the combination of BIBW2992 and rapamycin is the most effective treatment paradigm causing significant tumor shrinkage. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung tumors treated with BIBW2992 and rapamycin combination revealed decreased phosphorylation levels for proteins in both upstream and downstream arms of MAPK and Akt/mTOR signaling axes, indicating inhibition of these pathways. Based on these findings, clinical testing of the BIBW2992/rapamycin combination in non-small cell lung cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 mutations is warranted.

219ad69c-3a3b-535b-89eb-b404e8ff2d8b	B	High CDK6 Protects Cells from Fulvestrant-Mediated Apoptosis and is a Predictor of Resistance to Fulvestrant in Estrogen Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.	PURPOSE: Resistance to endocrine therapy in estrogen receptor-positive (ER<sup>+</sup>) breast cancer remains a major clinical problem. Recently, the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib combined with letrozole or fulvestrant was approved for treatment of ER<sup>+</sup> advanced breast cancer. However, the role of CDK4/6 in endocrine resistance and their potential as predictive biomarkers of endocrine treatment response remains undefined. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the specific role of increased CDK6 expression in fulvestrant-resistant cells by gene knockdown and treatment with palbociclib, and evaluated the effect in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and kinase activity. Furthermore, we evaluated CDK6 expression in metastatic samples from breast cancer patients treated or not with fulvestrant. RESULTS: We found increased expression of CDK6 in two fulvestrant-resistant cell models versus sensitive cells. Reduction of CDK6 expression impaired fulvestrant-resistant cell growth and induced apoptosis. Treatment with palbociclib resensitized fulvestrant-resistant cells to fulvestrant through alteration of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. High CDK6 levels in metastatic samples from two independent cohorts of breast cancer patients treated with fulvestrant (N = 45 and 46) correlated significantly with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) on fulvestrant treatment (P = 0.0006 and 0.018), whereas no association was observed in patients receiving other first- or second-/third-line endocrine treatments (N = 68, P = 0.135 and 0.511, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that upregulation of CDK6 may be an important mechanism in overcoming fulvestrant-mediated growth inhibition in breast cancer cells. Patients with advanced ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer exhibiting high CDK6 expression in the metastatic lesions show shorter PFS upon fulvestrant treatment and thus may benefit from the addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors in their therapeutic regimens. Clin Cancer Res; 22(22); 5514-26. ©2016 AACR.	B	high	The study includes primary patient data from two independent cohorts of breast cancer patients (N=45 and N=46) which are both greater than 5 patients.

4a9a7469-2e77-5179-91a1-00fc5cd2bdb1	D	Potent activity of ponatinib (AP24534) in models of FLT3-driven acute myeloid leukemia and other hematologic malignancies.	Ponatinib (AP24534) is a novel multitargeted kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits native and mutant BCR-ABL at clinically achievable drug levels. Ponatinib also has in vitro inhibitory activity against a discrete set of kinases implicated in the pathogenesis of other hematologic malignancies, including FLT3, KIT, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), and platelet derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα). Here, using leukemic cell lines containing activated forms of each of these receptors, we show that ponatinib potently inhibits receptor phosphorylation and cellular proliferation with IC50 values comparable to those required for inhibition of BCR-ABL (0.3 to 20 nmol/L). The activity of ponatinib against the FLT3-ITD mutant, found in up to 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, was particularly notable. In MV4-11 (FLT3-ITD(+/+)) but not RS4;11 (FLT3-ITD(-/-)) AML cells, ponatinib inhibited FLT3 signaling and induced apoptosis at concentrations of less than 10 nmol/L. In an MV4-11 mouse xenograft model, once daily oral dosing of ponatinib led to a dose-dependent inhibition of signaling and tumor regression. Ponatinib inhibited viability of primary leukemic blasts from a FLT3-ITD positive AML patient (IC50 4 nmol/L) but not those isolated from 3 patients with AML expressing native FLT3. Overall, these results support the investigation of ponatinib in patients with FLT3-ITD-driven AML and other hematologic malignancies driven by KIT, FGFR1, or PDGFRα.	D	high	The study primarily describes experiments conducted using leukemic cell lines (in vitro) and a mouse xenograft model (in vivo).

49e550d8-6450-587c-8aec-8fbac156518e	B	Randomized phase II study of erlotinib in combination with placebo or R1507, a monoclonal antibody to insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, for advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer.	PURPOSE: R1507 is a selective, fully human, recombinant monoclonal antibody (immunoglobulin G1 subclass) against insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R). The strong preclinical evidence supporting coinhibition of IGF-1R and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as anticancer therapy prompted this study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression following one or two prior regimens, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2, and measurable disease were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib (150 mg orally once a day) in combination with either placebo, R1507 9 mg/kg weekly, or R1507 16 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks. Treatment cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. The primary end point was comparison of the 12-week progression-free survival (PFS) rate. RESULTS: In all, 172 patients were enrolled: median age, 61 years; female, 33%; never-smokers, 12%; and performance status 0 or 1, 88%. The median number of R1507 doses was six for the weekly arm and 3.5 for the every-3-weeks arm. Grades 3 to 4 adverse events occurred in 37%, 44%, and 48% of patients with placebo, R1507 weekly, and R1507 every 3 weeks, respectively. The 12-week PFS rates were 39%, 37%, and 44%, and the median overall survival was 8.1, 8.1, and 12.1 months for the three groups, respectively, with statistically nonsignificant hazard ratios. The 12-week PFS rate in patients with KRAS mutation was 36% with R1507 compared with 0% with placebo. CONCLUSION: The combination of R1507 with erlotinib did not provide PFS or survival advantage over erlotinib alone in an unselected group of patients with advanced NSCLC. Predictive biomarkers are essential for further development of combined inhibition of IGF-1R and EGFR.

d2dd2e33-07b2-5632-a23e-767bd6fe24ec	B	Molecular determinants of the response of glioblastomas to EGFR kinase inhibitors.	BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently amplified, overexpressed, or mutated in glioblastomas, but only 10 to 20 percent of patients have a response to EGFR kinase inhibitors. The mechanism of responsiveness of glioblastomas to these inhibitors is unknown. METHODS: We sequenced kinase domains in the EGFR and human EGFR type 2 (Her2/neu) genes and analyzed the expression of EGFR, EGFR deletion mutant variant III (EGFRvIII), and the tumor-suppressor protein PTEN in recurrent malignant gliomas from patients who had received EGFR kinase inhibitors. We determined the molecular correlates of clinical response, validated them in an independent data set, and identified effects of the molecular abnormalities in vitro. RESULTS: Of 49 patients with recurrent malignant glioma who were treated with EGFR kinase inhibitors, 9 had tumor shrinkage of at least 25 percent. Pretreatment tissue was available for molecular analysis from 26 patients, 7 of whom had had a response and 19 of whom had rapid progression during therapy. No mutations in EGFR or Her2/neu kinase domains were detected in the tumors. Coexpression of EGFRvIII and PTEN was significantly associated with a clinical response (P<0.001; odds ratio, 51; 95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 669). These findings were validated in 33 patients who received similar treatment for glioblastoma at a different institution (P=0.001; odds ratio, 40; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 468). In vitro, coexpression of EGFRvIII and PTEN sensitized glioblastoma cells to erlotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Coexpression of EGFRvIII and PTEN by glioblastoma cells is associated with responsiveness to EGFR kinase inhibitors.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from a cohort of 49 patients, with molecular analysis performed on 26 of them, and subsequent validation in an independent cohort of 33 patients. It presents statistical results (P-values, odds ratios, confidence intervals) demonstrating a significant association between molecular markers and clinical response to EGFR kinase inhibitors. This constitutes strong clinical evidence, fitting the description of 'Clinical trials (Phase I–III) or primary patient data with >5 patients. Has statistical results but less definitive than Level A.' The in vitro component supports the clinical findings but the primary evidence is clinical.

Bosutinib, a dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, has shown potent activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this phase 1/2 study we evaluated bosutinib in patients with chronic phase imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study to determine the recommended starting dose for part 2; part 2 evaluated the efficacy and safety of bosutinib 500 mg once-daily dosing. The study enrolled 288 patients with imatinib-resistant (n = 200) or imatinib-intolerant (n = 88) CML and no other previous kinase inhibitor exposure. At 24 weeks, 31% of patients achieved major cytogenetic response (primary end point). After a median follow-up of 24.2 months, 86% of patients achieved complete hematologic remission, 53% had a major cytogenetic response (41% had a complete cytogenetic response), and 64% of those achieving complete cytogenetic response had a major molecular response. At 2 years, progression-free survival was 79%; overall survival at 2 years was 92%. Responses were seen across Bcr-Abl mutants, except T315I. Bosutinib exhibited an acceptable safety profile; the most common treatment-emergent adverse event was mild/moderate, typically self-limiting diarrhea. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic adverse events (> 2% of patients) included diarrhea (9%), rash (9%), and vomiting (3%). These data suggest bosutinib is effective and tolerable in patients with chronic phase imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML.

e6fa9c37-b838-55f6-a126-f3d498da7846	B	A multicenter DeCOG study on predictors of vemurafenib therapy outcome in melanoma: pretreatment impacts survival.	BACKGROUND: Kinase inhibitors targeting the BRAF V600 mutation have become standard in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Albeit in wide clinical use, the patterns associated with therapy outcome are not fully elucidated. The present study was aimed to identify predictive factors of therapy response and survival under the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study analyzed patient, tumor, and pretreatment characteristics collected in BRAF V600-mutated stage IV melanoma patients before single-agent therapy with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. RESULTS: A total of 300 patients from 14 centers were included into this study with a median follow-up time of 13.0 months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.1 months; median overall survival (OS) was 7.6 months. Best response under vemurafenib was associated with serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; ≤ versus >upper normal limit; P = 0.0000001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) overall performance status (OPS) (0 versus ≥ 1; P = 0.00089), and BRAF mutation subtype (V600E versus V600K; P = 0.016). Multivariate analysis identified ECOG OPS ≥ 1 [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.88; P = 0.00005], immunotherapy pretreatment (HR = 0.53; P = 0.0067), elevated serum LDH (HR = 1.45; P = 0.012), age >55 years (HR = 0.72; P = 0.019), and chemotherapy pretreatment (HR = 1.39; P = 0.036) as independent predictors of PFS. For OS, elevated serum LDH (HR = 1.99; P = 0.00012), ECOG OPS ≥ 1 (HR = 1.90; P = 0.00063), age >55 years (HR = 0.65; P = 0.011), kinase inhibitor pretreatment (HR = 1.86; P = 0.014), immunotherapy pretreatment (HR = 0.57; P = 0.025), chemotherapy pretreatment (HR = 2.17; P = 0.039), and male gender (HR = 0.70; 95% confidence interval 0.50-0.98; P = 0.039) were found as predictors. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that the type of pretreatment strongly influences the outcome of vemurafenib therapy, with a precedent immunotherapy showing a positive, and a prior chemotherapy and kinase inhibitors showing a negative impact on survival, respectively. Moreover, we show that the patient's OPS, serum LDH, age, and gender independently impact vemurafenib therapy outcome. These findings should be taken into account for the future design of therapy sequencing in BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma patients.

12d1ad30-55e5-5b58-b061-e17df4ecdddc	A	Durable Remissions with Ivosidenib in IDH1-Mutated Relapsed or Refractory AML.	BACKGROUND: Mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1) occur in 6 to 10% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ivosidenib (AG-120) is an oral, targeted, small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH1. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of ivosidenib monotherapy in IDH1-mutated AML. Safety and efficacy were assessed in all treated patients. The primary efficacy population included patients with relapsed or refractory AML receiving 500 mg of ivosidenib daily with at least 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, 258 patients received ivosidenib and had safety outcomes assessed. Among patients with relapsed or refractory AML (179 patients), treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher that occurred in at least 3 patients were prolongation of the QT interval (in 7.8% of the patients), the IDH differentiation syndrome (in 3.9%), anemia (in 2.2%), thrombocytopenia or a decrease in the platelet count (in 3.4%), and leukocytosis (in 1.7%). In the primary efficacy population (125 patients), the rate of complete remission or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery was 30.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.5 to 39.3), the rate of complete remission was 21.6% (95% CI, 14.7 to 29.8), and the overall response rate was 41.6% (95% CI, 32.9 to 50.8). The median durations of these responses were 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 12.0), 9.3 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 18.3), and 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 9.3), respectively. Transfusion independence was attained in 29 of 84 patients (35%), and patients who had a response had fewer infections and febrile neutropenia episodes than those who did not have a response. Among 34 patients who had a complete remission or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery, 7 (21%) had no residual detectable IDH1 mutations on digital polymerase-chain-reaction assay. No preexisting co-occurring single gene mutation predicted clinical response or resistance to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced IDH1-mutated relapsed or refractory AML, ivosidenib at a dose of 500 mg daily was associated with a low frequency of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events and with transfusion independence, durable remissions, and molecular remissions in some patients with complete remission.

BACKGROUND: More than half of patients with KRAS-wild type advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) fail anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. We studied EGFR-axis messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and RAS, RAF, PIK3CA mutations in order to identify additional biomarkers of cetuximab efficacy. METHODS: Previously genotyped (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA mutations) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour biopsies of 226 cetuximab-treated CRC patients (1st to 3rd line therapy) were assessed for mRNA expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands EGF, Transofrming Growth Factor-a (TGFA), Amphiregulin (AREG) and Epiregulin (EREG) with real time quantitative PCR. Mutations were detected in 72 (31.9%) tumours for KRAS, in 6 (2.65%) for BRAF, in 7 (3.1%) for NRAS and in 37 (16.4%) for PIK3CA. RESULTS: Only PIK3CA mutations occasionally coexisted with other gene mutations. In univariate analysis, prognostic significance for survival ( from metastases until death) was seen for BRAF mutations (Hazard Ratio HR 8.1, 95% CI 3.4-19), codon 12-only KRAS mutations (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), high AREG mRNA expression only in KRAS wild type CRC (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.3-0.7) and high EREG mRNA expression irrespective of KRAS mutation status (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28-0.7). EREG tumoural mRNA expression was significantly associated with a 2.26-fold increased likelihood of objective response to cetuximab therapy (RECIST 1.1). In multivariate analysis, favourable predictive factors were high AREG mRNA in KRAS wild type tumours, high EREG mRNA, low Ephrin A2 receptor mRNA. Cetuximab-treated patients with AREG-low KRAS wild type CRC fared very poorly, their survival being similar to KRAS mutant CRC. Patients with KRAS codon 13 or other non-codon 12 mutations had a median survival (30 months, 95% CI 20-35) similar to that of patients with KRAS wild-type (median survival 29 months, 95% CI 25-35), in contrast to patients with KRAS codon 12 mutations who fared worse (median survival 19 months, 95% CI 15-26). CONCLUSIONS: BRAF and codon 12 KRAS mutations predict for adverse outcome of CRC patients receiving cetuximab. AREG mRNA reflects EGFR signalling in KRAS wild type tumours, predicting for cetuximab efficacy when high and failure when low. EREG may have a prognostic role independent of KRAS mutation.	B	high	This study is a retrospective analysis of primary patient data from 226 cetuximab-treated colorectal cancer patients.

6d0ce9c3-afb6-531f-99c6-202bfef621a5	D	Gilteritinib, a FLT3/AXL inhibitor, shows antileukemic activity in mouse models of FLT3 mutated acute myeloid leukemia.	Advances in the understanding of the molecular basis for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have generated new potential targets for treatment. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in AML and mutations in this gene are associated with poor overall survival. AXL plays a role in the activation of FLT3 and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AML. The studies reported here evaluated the ability of a novel FLT3/AXL inhibitor, gilteritinib, to block mutated FLT3 in cellular and animal models of AML. Initial kinase studies showed that gilteritinib, a type I tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was highly selective for both FLT3 and AXL while having weak activity against c-KIT. Gilteritinib demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against the internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and FLT3-D835Y point mutations in cellular assays using MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells as well as Ba/F3 cells expressing mutated FLT3. Gilteritinib also inhibited FLT3-F691 mutations, although to a lesser degree, in these assays. Furthermore, gilteritinib decreased the phosphorylation levels of FLT3 and its downstream targets in both cellular and animal models. In vivo, gilteritinib was distributed at high levels in xenografted tumors after oral administration. The decreased FLT3 activity and high intratumor distribution of gilteritinib translated to tumor regression and improved survival in xenograft and intra-bone marrow transplantation models of FLT3-driven AML. No overt toxicity was seen in mouse models treated with gilteritinib. These results indicate that gilteritinib may be an important next-generation FLT3 inhibitor for use in the treatment of FLT3 mutation-positive AML.	D	high	The study exclusively uses in vitro cellular assays (MV4-11, MOLM-13, Ba/F3 cells) and in vivo animal models (xenograft and intra-bone marrow transplantation mouse models) to evaluate the antileukemic activity of gilteritinib. There is no mention of human clinical trials or patient data.
7b9fedee-a500-519e-bcfc-8ff3d3a5d5d9	C	Acquired resistance of lung adenocarcinomas to gefitinib or erlotinib is associated with a second mutation in the EGFR kinase domain.	"BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinomas from patients who respond to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib (Iressa) or erlotinib (Tarceva) usually harbor somatic gain-of-function mutations in exons encoding the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Despite initial responses, patients eventually progress by unknown mechanisms of ""acquired"" resistance. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We show that in two of five patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib, progressing tumors contain, in addition to a primary drug-sensitive mutation in EGFR, a secondary mutation in exon 20, which leads to substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 (T790M) in the kinase domain. Tumor cells from a sixth patient with a drug-sensitive EGFR mutation whose tumor progressed on adjuvant gefitinib after complete resection also contained the T790M mutation. This mutation was not detected in untreated tumor samples. Moreover, no tumors with acquired resistance had KRAS mutations, which have been associated with primary resistance to these drugs. Biochemical analyses of transfected cells and growth inhibition studies with lung cancer cell lines demonstrate that the T790M mutation confers resistance to EGFR mutants usually sensitive to either gefitinib or erlotinib. Interestingly, a mutation analogous to T790M has been observed in other kinases with acquired resistance to another kinase inhibitor, imatinib (Gleevec). CONCLUSION: In patients with tumors bearing gefitinib- or erlotinib-sensitive EGFR mutations, resistant subclones containing an additional EGFR mutation emerge in the presence of drug. This observation should help guide the search for more effective therapy against a specific subset of lung cancers."	B	high	The study presents primary patient data from a series of 6 patients where the T790M mutation was identified in tumors with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. This fits the definition of 'primary patient data with >5 patients' for Level B. While the study also includes preclinical evidence (cell lines), the core finding regarding the T790M mutation's association with acquired resistance is based on direct human observation in a small cohort.
77dba4b0-4223-5c08-9036-db3dd12ecf72	D	HER2YVMA drives rapid development of adenosquamous lung tumors in mice that are sensitive to BIBW2992 and rapamycin combination therapy.	Mutations in the HER2 kinase domain have been identified in human clinical lung cancer specimens. Here we demonstrate that inducible expression of the most common HER2 mutant (HER2(YVMA)) in mouse lung epithelium causes invasive adenosquamous carcinomas restricted to proximal and distal bronchioles. Continuous expression of HER2(YVMA) is essential for tumor maintenance, suggesting a key role for HER2 in lung adenosquamous tumorigenesis. Preclinical studies assessing the in vivo effect of erlotinib, trastuzumab, BIBW2992, and/or rapamycin on HER2(YVMA) transgenic mice or H1781 xenografts with documented tumor burden revealed that the combination of BIBW2992 and rapamycin is the most effective treatment paradigm causing significant tumor shrinkage. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung tumors treated with BIBW2992 and rapamycin combination revealed decreased phosphorylation levels for proteins in both upstream and downstream arms of MAPK and Akt/mTOR signaling axes, indicating inhibition of these pathways. Based on these findings, clinical testing of the BIBW2992/rapamycin combination in non-small cell lung cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 mutations is warranted.	D	high	The study describes 'Preclinical studies' using 'HER2(YVMA) transgenic mice' and 'H1781 xenografts' to assess treatment effects.

890f881d-61d4-5b41-a787-c2d2e84114e1	B	Preoperative chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, lapatinib, or both in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive operable breast cancer: results of the randomized phase II CHER-LOB study.	PURPOSE: This is a noncomparative, randomized, phase II trial of preoperative taxane-anthracycline in combination with trastuzumab, lapatinib, or combined trastuzumab plus lapatinib in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive, stage II to IIIA operable breast cancer. The primary aim was to estimate the percentage of pathologic complete response (pCR; no invasive tumor in breast and axillary nodes). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the three arms, chemotherapy consisted of weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2)) for 12 weeks followed by fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide for four courses every 3 weeks. The patients randomly assigned to arm A received a 4-mg loading dose of trastuzumab followed by 2 mg weekly; in arm B patients received lapatinib 1,500 mg orally (PO) daily; and in arm C, patients received trastuzumab and lapatinib 1,000 mg PO daily. RESULTS: A total of 121 patients were randomly assigned. Diarrhea and dermatologic and hepatic toxicities were observed more frequently in patients receiving lapatinib. No episodes of congestive heart failure were observed. The rates of breast-conserving surgery were 66.7%, 57.9%, and 68.9% in arms A, B and C, respectively. The pCR rates were 25% (90% CI, 13.1% to 36.9%) in arm A, 26.3% (90% CI, 14.5% to 38.1%) in arm B, and 46.7% (90% CI, 34.4% to 58.9%) in arm C (exploratory P = .019). CONCLUSION: The primary end point of the study was met, with a relative increase of 80% in the pCR rate achieved with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and lapatinib compared with chemotherapy plus either trastuzumab or lapatinib. These data add further evidence supporting the superiority of a dual-HER2 inhibition for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.	B	high	This is a randomized phase II clinical trial involving 121 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. It presents primary patient data with statistical results (pCR rates and confidence intervals), which aligns with the definition of Level B clinical evidence.
d48023f5-2a4e-5ee5-952c-ff749f4718cb	D	ATM mutations uniformly lead to ATM dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: application of functional test using doxorubicin.	ATM abnormalities are frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and represent an important prognostic factor. Sole 11q deletion does not result in ATM inactivation by contrast to biallelic defects involving mutations. Therefore, the analysis of ATM mutations and their functional impact is crucial. In this study, we analyzed ATM mutations in predominantly high-risk patients using: i) resequencing microarray and direct sequencing; ii) Western blot for total ATM level; iii) functional test based on p21 gene induction after parallel treatment of leukemic cells with fludarabine and doxorubicin. ATM dysfunction leads to impaired p21 induction after doxorubicin exposure. We detected ATM mutation in 16% (22 of 140) of patients, and all mutated samples manifested demonstrable ATM defect (impaired p21 upregulation after doxorubicin and/or null protein level). Loss of ATM function in mutated samples was also evidenced through defective p53 pathway activation after ionizing radiation exposure. ATM mutation frequency was 34% in patients with 11q deletion, 4% in the TP53-defected group, and 8% in wild-type patients. Our functional test, convenient for routine use, showed high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (97%) for ATM mutations prediction. Only cells with ATM mutation, but not those with sole 11q deletion, were resistant to doxorubicin. As far as fludarabine is concerned, this difference was not observed. Interestingly, patients from both these groups experienced nearly identical time to first treatment. In conclusion, ATM mutations either alone or in combination with 11q deletion uniformly led to demonstrable ATM dysfunction in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mutation presence can be predicted by the functional test using doxorubicin.	B	high	The study involves primary patient data from 140 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It analyzes ATM mutations and their functional impact, and evaluates a functional test for ATM dysfunction, reporting statistical results such as sensitivity (80%) and specificity (97%). This aligns with Level B, which includes clinical studies with primary patient data from more than 5 patients and statistical results.
2c855374-9ee7-5958-a017-6de961460443	D	Activation of PI3K/Akt pathway by PTEN reduction and PIK3CA mRNA amplification contributes to cisplatin resistance in an ovarian cancer cell line.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand the role of PIK3CA and PTEN on the resistance of human ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. METHODS: Human ovarian cancer cell OVCAR-3 and cisplatin-resistant subclone OVCAR-3/CDDP cells were used for these studies. The expressions of apoptosis regulating proteins and PI3K/Akt signaling proteins were systematically examined. RESULTS: OVCAR-3/CDDP cells were 4.8-fold more resistant to cisplatin compared to OVCAR-3 cells following 72 h exposure to this drug. This resistance was paralleled with reduced susceptibility to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Apoptotic proteins were differentially expressed in OVCAR-3/CDDP cells, resulting in the inhibition of Bax translocalization. Cisplatin inhibited Akt phosphorylation and activation in OVCAR-3 cells but not in OVCAR-3/CDDP cells. The specific PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin sensitized OVCAR-3/CDDP cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and decreased cell viability. A low level of PTEN expression was strongly associated with amplified PIK3CA and PI3K/Akt activities in OVCAR-3/CDDP cells. Small interfering RNA knockdown of PTEN and the expression of active p110alpha resulted in a blockade of apoptosis by cisplatin in OVCAR-3 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results collectively indicate that the development of resistance in OVCAR-3 cells was derived by increased PIK3CA transcription and reduction of PTEN expression. These alterations conferred cisplatin resistance to cisplatin through the activation of PI3K/Akt and the inhibition of Bax translocation.	D	high	The study exclusively uses human ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR-3 and OVCAR-3/CDDP) to investigate the mechanisms of cisplatin resistance. This falls under the definition of preclinical evidence using in vitro models.
ad1691cf-b4ca-53fe-90d3-c7eccb972c3e	D	Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 as a putative therapy target in colorectal cancer.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Resembling a potential therapeutic drug target, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification and expression was assessed in 515 human colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue samples, lymph node metastases and CRC cell lines. METHODS: FGFR1 amplification status was determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Additionally, we assessed protein levels employing Western blots and immunohistochemistry. The FGFR1 mRNA localization was analyzed using mRNA in situ hybridization. Functional studies employed the FGFR inhibitor NVP-BGJ398. RESULTS: Of 454 primary CRCs, 24 displayed FGFR1 amplification. 92/94 lymph node metastases presented the same amplification status as the primary tumor. Of 99 investigated tumors, 18 revealed membranous activated pFGFR1 protein. FGFR1 mRNA levels were independent of the amplification status or pFGFR1 protein occurrence. In vitro, a strong antiproliferative effect of NVP-BGJ398 could be detected in cell lines exhibiting high FGFR1 protein. CONCLUSION: FGFR1 is a potential therapeutic target in a subset of CRC. FGFR1 protein is likely to represent a central factor limiting the efficacy of FGFR inhibitors. The lack of correlation between its evaluation at genetic/mRNA level and its protein occurrence indicates that the assessment of the receptor at an immunohistochemical level most likely represents a suitable way to assess FGFR1 as a predictive biomarker for patient selection in future clinical trials.	D	high	The study primarily investigates the presence and characteristics of FGFR1 in human colorectal cancer tissue samples (515 samples). While this involves primary human data, the functional studies demonstrating the antiproliferative effect of the FGFR inhibitor NVP-BGJ398 were conducted 'in vitro' using cell lines. The conclusion identifies FGFR1 as a 'potential therapeutic target' and a 'predictive biomarker for patient selection in future clinical trials,' indicating that direct clinical evidence of therapeutic efficacy in humans is not presented. Therefore, the evidence for the therapeutic aspect is preclinical.
8372b753-a39a-5444-8d89-e5db15ca59e2	D	The First-in-class Anti-EGFR Antibody Mixture Sym004 Overcomes Cetuximab Resistance Mediated by EGFR Extracellular Domain Mutations in Colorectal Cancer.	PURPOSE: Approved anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab provide significant clinical benefit in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC). However, patients ultimately develop disease progression, often driven by acquisition of mutations in the extracellular domain (ECD) of EGFR. Sym004 is a novel 1:1 mixture of two nonoverlapping anti-EGFR mAbs that recently showed promising clinical activity in a phase I trial in MCRC. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of Sym004 to circumvent cetuximab resistance driven by EGFR ECD mutations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Functional studies were performed to assess drug-receptor binding as well as ligand-dependent activation of individual EGFR mutants in the presence of cetuximab, panitumumab, and Sym004. Cell viability and molecular effects of the drugs were assayed in cetuximab-resistant cell lines and in tumor xenograft models. Efficacy of Sym004 was evaluated in patients progressing to cetuximab that harbored EGFR mutation in the post-cetuximab tumor sample. RESULTS: Contrary to cetuximab and panitumumab, Sym004 effectively bound and abrogated ligand-induced phosphorylation of all individual EGFR mutants. Cells resistant to cetuximab harboring mutations in EGFR maintained sensitivity to Sym004, which was consistent with an effective suppression of EGFR downstream signaling, translating into profound and sustained tumor regression in the xenograft model. As proof-of-principle, a patient with a tumor harboring an EGFR mutation (G465R) following cetuximab therapy benefited from Sym004 therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Sym004 is an active drug in MCRC resistant to cetuximab/panitumumab mediated by EGFR mutations. EGFR mutations are potential biomarkers of response to Sym004 to be evaluated in ongoing large clinical trials. Clin Cancer Res; 22(13); 3260-7. ©2016 AACR.	C	high	The study primarily presents preclinical evidence from in vitro cell line experiments and in vivo xenograft models (Level D). However, it also includes 'proof-of-principle' data from 'a patient' with an EGFR mutation who benefited from Sym004 therapy, which constitutes a case study (Level C). Since a case study represents direct human evidence, it takes precedence over purely preclinical data.
8485d8f5-57c4-5fcc-b607-07466f43e349	C	Molecular correlates of imatinib resistance in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.	PURPOSE: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) commonly harbor oncogenic mutations of the KIT or platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFRA) kinases, which are targets for imatinib. In clinical studies, 75% to 90% of patients with advanced GISTs experience clinical benefit from imatinib. However, imatinib resistance is an increasing clinical problem. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-seven patients with advanced, unresectable GISTs were enrolled onto a randomized, phase II clinical study of imatinib. Specimens from pretreatment and/or imatinib-resistant tumors were analyzed to identify molecular correlates of imatinib resistance. Secondary kinase mutations of KIT or PDGFRA that were identified in imatinib-resistant GISTs were biochemically profiled for imatinib sensitivity. RESULTS: Molecular studies were performed using specimens from 10 patients with primary and 33 patients with secondary resistance. Imatinib-resistant tumors had levels of activated KIT that were similar to or greater than those typically found in untreated GISTs. Secondary kinase mutations were rare in GISTs with primary resistance but frequently found in GISTs with secondary resistance (10% v 67%; P = .002). Evidence for clonal evolution and/or polyclonal secondary kinase mutations was seen in three (18.8%) of 16 patients. Secondary kinase mutations were nonrandomly distributed and were associated with decreased imatinib sensitivity compared with typical KIT exon 11 mutations. Using RNAi technology, we demonstrated that imatinib-resistant GIST cells remain dependent on KIT kinase activity for activation of critical downstream signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: Different molecular mechanisms are responsible for primary and secondary imatinib resistance in GISTs. These findings have implications for future approaches to the growing problem of imatinib resistance in patients with advanced GISTs.	B	high	The study is a randomized, phase II clinical trial involving 147 patients with advanced GISTs. Molecular studies were performed on specimens from 43 patients, providing primary patient data with statistical results (e.g., P = .002). This directly aligns with the definition of Level B for clinical trials or primary patient data with more than 5 patients and statistical results.
09ba1eac-0569-5005-8a87-f71ac5dd1ce2	B	Dabrafenib and trametinib, alone and in combination for BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma.	Dabrafenib and trametinib were approved for use as monotherapies in BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013, and most recently, their use in combination has received accelerated FDA approval. Both drugs target the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway: dabrafenib selectively inhibits mutant BRAF that constitutively activates the pathway, and trametinib selectively inhibits MEK1 and MEK2 proteins activated by RAF kinases. The phase III study of dabrafenib in BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma reported rapid tumor regression in most patients and a 59% objective RECIST response rate. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were improved compared with dacarbazine. Toxicities were well tolerated and different from those reported for vemurafenib, the first FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor. Efficacy has been demonstrated in other BRAF-mutant genotypes. The phase III study of trametinib in BRAF inhibitor-naïve patients with BRAF(V600E) or BRAF(V600K) also showed benefit with a prolonged median PFS and OS compared with chemotherapy. Trametinib is ineffective in patients who have progressed on BRAF inhibitors. A phase II trial of combined dabrafenib and trametinib demonstrated higher response rates and longer median PFS than dabrafenib monotherapy, with less cutaneous toxicity. Here, we review the clinical development of both drugs as monotherapies and in combination, and discuss their role in the management of BRAF-mutant melanoma.	A	high	The abstract explicitly references multiple Phase III clinical trials for both dabrafenib and trametinib as monotherapies and in combination. It also mentions FDA approvals for these treatments. Phase III clinical trials and FDA approvals are key examples of Level A evidence, representing validated associations and practice-changing evidence.

PURPOSE: The phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt pathway is frequently altered in breast cancer. PTEN, a phosphatase that opposes the effect of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, can be mutated or lost, whereas the PIK3CA gene is mutated. These have been proposed as alternative mechanisms, and their clinicalpathology significance is under discussion. In this study, we aimed to explore whether PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss are mutually exclusive mechanisms, correlate with other known clinicopathologic markers, or have clinical implication in breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Exons 9 and 20 of the PIK3CA gene were analyzed in 270 breast tumors, and mutations were detected by single-stranded conformational analysis followed by sequencing. The expression of PTEN was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 201 tumors. RESULTS: PIK3CA mutations were found in 24% of the tumors and associated with estrogen receptor(+) status, small size, negative HER2 status, high Akt1, and high cyclin D1 protein expression. PTEN was negative in 37% of the cases and PTEN loss was associated with PIK3CA mutations (P = 0.0024). Tumors presenting PTEN loss or both alterations were often estrogen receptor(+), small in size, and HER2(-). PIK3CA mutations predicted for longer local recurrence-free survival. Moreover, PTEN loss by itself or combined with mutated PIK3CA tended to confer radiosensitivity. In addition, the patients with high S-phase fraction had longer recurrence-free survival if they carried mutations in the PIK3CA gene and/or had lost PTEN, whereas the same alterations were associated with shorter recurrence-free survival among patients with low S-phase fraction. CONCLUSIONS: PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss were not mutually exclusive events and associated with similar prognostic factors.	B	high	The study analyzes PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss in a cohort of 270 and 201 human breast tumors, respectively. This constitutes primary patient data with a sample size significantly greater than 5 patients, and the abstract presents statistical results regarding associations with clinicopathologic markers and survival. It is not a Phase III clinical trial or practice-changing evidence, making it less definitive than Level A, but clearly clinical evidence.
b544bd80-6b2f-5cfd-8cbf-ba9ab4ec7708	D	Ponatinib inhibits polyclonal drug-resistant KIT oncoproteins and shows therapeutic potential in heavily pretreated gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients.	PURPOSE: KIT is the major oncogenic driver of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib are approved therapies; however, efficacy is often limited by the acquisition of polyclonal secondary resistance mutations in KIT, with those located in the activation (A) loop (exons 17/18) being particularly problematic. Here, we explore the KIT-inhibitory activity of ponatinib in preclinical models and describe initial characterization of its activity in patients with GIST. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cellular and in vivo activities of ponatinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib against mutant KIT were evaluated using an accelerated mutagenesis assay and a panel of engineered and GIST-derived cell lines. The ponatinib-KIT costructure was also determined. The clinical activity of ponatinib was examined in three patients with GIST previously treated with all three FDA-approved agents. RESULTS: In engineered and GIST-derived cell lines, ponatinib potently inhibited KIT exon 11 primary mutants and a range of secondary mutants, including those within the A-loop. Ponatinib also induced regression in engineered and GIST-derived tumor models containing these secondary mutations. In a mutagenesis screen, 40 nmol/L ponatinib was sufficient to suppress outgrowth of all secondary mutants except V654A, which was suppressed at 80 nmol/L. This inhibitory profile could be rationalized on the basis of structural analyses. Ponatinib (30 mg daily) displayed encouraging clinical activity in two of three patients with GIST. CONCLUSION: Ponatinib possesses potent activity against most major clinically relevant KIT mutants and has demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity in patients with refractory GIST. These data strongly support further evaluation of ponatinib in patients with GIST.	C	high	The study includes both preclinical (in vitro and in vivo models) and clinical evidence. The clinical evidence is based on a very small patient series of three patients, which falls under the definition of Level C (Case Study: case reports or very small patient series <5 patients). While there is also preclinical data (Level D), the direct human evidence, even if limited, places it at Level C.
2a83ba12-8e19-5dca-87e5-1d89fabdb170	D	Comparison of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and INNO-406 in imatinib-resistant cell lines.	We compared the growth-inhibitory effects and inhibition profile of the SRC family kinases (SFKs) of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and INNO-406. Dasatinib exhibited the strongest potency against BCR-ABL with little selectivity over SFKs. Nilotinib exhibited a weaker affinity than the other inhibitors, but was highly specific for ABL and may be useful for the treatment of P-glycoprotein overexpressing leukemic cells. INNO-406 had an intermediate affinity for BCR-ABL between that of dasatinib and nilotinib, and inhibited only SFKs LCK and LYN among SFKs. Both nilotinib and INNO-406 were potent inhibitors of the dasatinib-resistant T315A, F317L and F317V BCR-ABL mutations.	D	high	The study explicitly states that it was conducted 'in imatinib-resistant cell lines' and describes 'growth-inhibitory effects' and 'inhibition profile' in these cell lines. This falls under preclinical evidence using in vitro models.
4f2bc9c3-4bb8-53ee-a5b1-c64b2cf2dc7a	B	Prognostic and clinicopathologic associations of oncogenic BRAF in metastatic melanoma.	PURPOSE: To assess the frequency and type of oncogenic BRAF mutations in metastatic melanoma and correlate BRAF status with clinicopathologic features and outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive BRAF-tested Australian patients with metastatic melanoma (n = 197) were observed prospectively. A comprehensive range of clinicopathologic variables were correlated with BRAF mutation status, and a survival analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent of patients had a BRAF mutation; 70 patients (74%) had V600E, 19 (20%) had V600K, and six (6%) had other genotypes. Other than age at diagnosis of distant metastasis (median age, 56 v 63 years for BRAF-mutant v BRAF wild-type patients, respectively; P < .001), there was no significant difference in clinical features of patients with metastatic melanoma by mutation status. Features of the antecedent primary melanoma significantly associated with a BRAF mutation (P < .05) were histopathologic subtype, presence of mitoses, single or occult primary melanoma, truncal location, and age at diagnosis of primary tumor ≤ 50 years. The interval from diagnosis of first-ever melanoma to distant metastasis was not significantly different between BRAF-mutant and BRAF wild-type patients; however, the median survival of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic melanoma was 5.7 months for BRAF-mutant patients not treated with a BRAF inhibitor, 8.5 months for BRAF wild-type patients, and not reached for BRAF-mutant patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor. CONCLUSION: V600K mutations comprised 20% of BRAF mutations. Characteristics of the antecedent primary melanoma and age at diagnosis differed in BRAF-mutant and BRAF wild-type patients. The presence of mutant BRAF had no impact on the disease-free interval from diagnosis of first-ever melanoma to first distant metastasis; however, it may have impacted survival thereafter.	B	high	This study is a prospective observational study involving a cohort of 197 consecutive BRAF-tested Australian patients with metastatic melanoma. It uses primary patient data to correlate BRAF status with clinicopathologic features and survival outcomes, including statistical analysis. This fits the definition of Level B, which includes 'primary patient data with >5 patients' and 'statistical results but less definitive than Level A'.
fec95c0c-3abf-5ef9-8e67-57666c8db999	B	Dasatinib treatment of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia: analysis of responses according to preexisting BCR-ABL mutations.	Dasatinib is a BCR-ABL inhibitor with 325-fold higher potency than imatinib against unmutated BCR-ABL in vitro. Imatinib failure is commonly caused by BCR-ABL mutations. Here, dasatinib efficacy was analyzed in patients recruited to phase 2/3 trials with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia with or without BCR-ABL mutations after prior imatinib. Among 1043 patients, 39% had a preexisting BCR-ABL mutation, including 48% of 805 patients with imatinib resistance or suboptimal response. Sixty-threedifferent BCR-ABL mutations affecting 49 amino acids were detected at baseline, with G250, M351, M244, and F359 most frequently affected. After 2 years of follow-up, dasatinib treatment of imatinib-resistant patients with or without a mutation resulted in notable response rates (complete cytogenetic response: 43% vs 47%) and durable progression-free survival (70% vs 80%). High response rates were achieved with different mutations except T315I, including highly imatinib-resistant mutations in the P-loop region. Impaired responses were observed with some mutations with a dasatinib median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) greater than 3nM; among patients with mutations with lower or unknown IC(50), efficacy was comparable with those with no mutation. Overall, dasatinib has durable efficacy in patients with or without BCR-ABL mutations. All trials were registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00123474, NCT00101660, and NCT00103844.	A	high	The publication is an analysis of data from large-scale phase 2/3 clinical trials involving 1043 patients. This represents strong clinical evidence, consistent with Level A, which includes Phase III clinical trials and aims for a proven/consensus association in human medicine.
f0b020ce-1085-54d3-916b-531c4b20cb47	D	Activating mutations in the NT5C2 nucleotidase gene drive chemotherapy resistance in relapsed ALL.	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of lymphoid progenitors. Despite intensive chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric patients and over 50% of adult patients with ALL do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge in the treatment of this disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identify mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2), which encodes a 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse T cell ALLs and 1/35 (3%) relapse B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts. These results support a prominent role for activating mutations in NT5C2 and increased nucleoside-analog metabolism in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance in ALL.	B	high	The study identifies activating mutations in the NT5C2 gene in a cohort of 103 T-cell ALL and 35 B-precursor ALL patients who experienced relapse. This constitutes primary patient data with a sample size greater than 5 patients, aligning with the definition of Level B evidence. The in vitro experiments provide additional mechanistic support.
77bfb6e4-1804-5299-8f2d-5549fc7b670d	D	Primary and secondary kinase genotypes correlate with the biological and clinical activity of sunitinib in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor.	PURPOSE: Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) harbor mutant KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) kinases, which are imatinib targets. Sunitinib, which targets KIT, PDGFRs, and several other kinases, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with GIST after they experience imatinib failure. We evaluated the impact of primary and secondary kinase genotype on sunitinib activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor responses were assessed radiologically in a phase I/II trial of sunitinib in 97 patients with metastatic, imatinib-resistant/intolerant GIST. KIT/PDGFRA mutational status was determined for 78 patients by using tumor specimens obtained before and after prior imatinib therapy. Kinase mutants were biochemically profiled for sunitinib and imatinib sensitivity. RESULTS: Clinical benefit (partial response or stable disease for > or = 6 months) with sunitinib was observed for the three most common primary GIST genotypes: KIT exon 9 (58%), KIT exon 11 (34%), and wild-type KIT/PDGFRA (56%). Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer for patients with primary KIT exon 9 mutations (P = .0005) or with a wild-type genotype (P = .0356) than for those with KIT exon 11 mutations. The same pattern was observed for overall survival (OS). PFS and OS were longer for patients with secondary KIT exon 13 or 14 mutations (which involve the KIT-adenosine triphosphate binding pocket) than for those with exon 17 or 18 mutations (which involve the KIT activation loop). Biochemical profiling studies confirmed the clinical results. CONCLUSION: The clinical activity of sunitinib after imatinib failure is significantly influenced by both primary and secondary mutations in the predominant pathogenic kinases, which has implications for optimization of the treatment of patients with GIST.	B	high	The abstract describes a phase I/II clinical trial involving 97 patients with metastatic, imatinib-resistant/intolerant GIST. It presents statistical results regarding clinical benefit, progression-free survival, and overall survival, which aligns with the definition of Level B for clinical trials with statistical results but less definitive than Level A.
